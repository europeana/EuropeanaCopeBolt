        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/140328-introduction-blog-post.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new Europeana Labs website is intended to provide all you need to get started using the Europeana APIs. Learn about the data, see what others have created, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year we consulted with the developer community asking them what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana APIs. This Europeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What's New?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. This is backed up by a revamp of the API documentation, providing everything you should need to exploit the full potential of the Europeana platform and get creative with the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Take a look at sample <a href=\"/data/\" title=\"Europeana Data\">Data</a>, chosen to highlight a wide range of content types such as photographs, audio, and maps, and themes like archaeology and natural history. Each dataset gives you the chance to view the items in the Europeana Portal, but also to explore and edit the underlying query via the API Console.</li>\r\n    <li>If you need inspiration explore our gallery of top <a href=\"/apps/\" title=\"Apps Gallery\">Apps</a>, showcasing innovative applications that have already been built using the Europeana platform.</li>\r\n    <li>You’ll also find details of <a href=\"/locations/\" title=\"Europeana Locations\">Locations</a>, labs and co-creation spaces across Europe which offer online and real-world places where you can go to play, develop, test and build.</li>\r\n    <li>All this is backed up by a new <a href=\"/blog/\" title=\"Europeana Labs blog\">Europeana Labs blog</a> where we'll be featuring hints &amp; tips and all the latest developments, plus a calendar of <a href=\"/events/\" title=\"Europeana Labs events\">forthcoming events</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>But wherever you are, whatever your skills, and no matter what you're planning, don't be afraid to <a href=\"#help\" title=\"help &amp; support\">ask for help</a> as we're here to support you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>API Documentation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have an idea and you want to start building your application, head to our comprehensive <a href=\"/api/\" title=\"API Documentation\">online documentation</a>. It covers both the REST API and Linked Open Data, with extensive examples illustrating methods, syntax, and responses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also use the <a href=\"/api/console/\" title=\"API Console\">API Console</a> to build and test anything from the simplest search to a complex query using facets such as dates, geotags and permissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you’re new to Europeana, getting started is simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/api/registration/\">Register for an API key</a></li>\r\n    <li>Use the <a href=\"/api/console/\" title=\"API Console\">API Console</a> to explore the content and customise queries. If you need help, check out the example <a href=\"/data/\" title=\"Example Data\">Datasets</a> and consult our extensive <a href=\"/api/\" title=\"API Documentation\">API documentation</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Build your application. If you don’t know where to start, find inspiration in the <a href=\"/apps/\" title=\"Application Gallery\">Application Gallery</a> - many applications have public code repositories and there’s also a Java library and Python wrapper available.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<h2>Need help?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of ways you can get help with using the Europeana APIs. Contact us directly via our <a href=\"/support/\" title=\"Europeana API Support\">contact form</a> or at api@europeana.eu. If you want to chat with fellow developers head over to the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/europeanaapi\">API Forum on Google Groups</a> and you can also <a href=\"http://twitter.com/europeanatech\">follow @EuropeanaTech</a> on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Send us your feedback!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Labs site is currently in beta, with a full launch planned in late June. We’d love to have your feedback on what you think works, and what needs improvement. We’re also happy to hear of any ideas you have.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'Uncovering the technology behind the simple search tool to discover reusable content available in both the Europeana portal and API.'
        body: "<p><em>This is an extract from a blog post previously published by Péter Király, software developer at Europeana. To read the full article visit <a href=\"http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana\">http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Europeana's important aims is to make the rights statements of records clear and straightforward. You can imagine, our &gt;2,400 partners have different approaches for licensing their objects, and right now in the database we have 60+ different licence types, in other words the RIGHTS facet has 60+ individual values. Some of them are language or version variations of the same CC licence. Most users don't want to select from that range of options. But we can categorize these rights statements under 3 main categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>freely reusable with attribution (CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA)</li>\r\n    <li>reusable with some restrictions (CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND, CC BY-ND, OOC NC)</li>\r\n    <li>reusable only with permissions (licences of the Europeana Rights Framework)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>How it was done</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europeana we use Apache Solr for searching. Our data model is called EDM (Europeana Data Model), which has almost 200 fields. We also have special fields for facets and we have some aggregated fields. What we wanted to achieve was to form a new facet from these options, but the most straightforward solution, i.e. to create a new field in Solr, was not an easily implementable option because it would require a full reindexing (it would be another blog entry to explain why that was not possible), so we had to search for another solution. To count the numbers belonging to the individual rights statements in the RIGHTS facet would work, but that's only good for displaying, and it doesn't cover the problem of user interaction. To use the RIGHTS field for search turned out to be risky because it interferes with the RIGHTS facet, so that did not worked either. Finally we come up with a fake facet, which has two sides: one on the display side, and one on the search side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To count the numbers we use a special Solr facet type: query facet. It is a simple, but at the same time a powerful solution. It doesn't give you a list of existing field values, as a normal facet. In the query facet the input is a query, and the returning value is a single number, which tells you how many records fit the combination of the main query and the query specified in the facet's parameter. Since we don't need to know the list of items in the categories, that's enough for us. We defined three queries:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>RIGHTS:(\"CC0\" OR \"CC BY\" OR \"CC BY SA\")</li>\r\n    <li>RIGHTS:(\"CC BY NC\" OR \"CC BY NC SA\" OR \"CC BY NC ND\" OR \"CC BY ND\" OR \"OOC NC\")</li>\r\n    <li>RIGHTS:(NOT(\"CC0\" OR \"CC BY\" OR \"CC BY SA\" OR \"CC BY NC\" OR \"CC BY NC SA\" OR \"CC BY NC ND\" OR \"CC BY ND\" OR \"OOC NC\"))</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Europeana portal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Europeana portal we use a fake facet called ”REUSABILITY”, and we use it in our filtering parameter (&amp;qf) as REUSABILITY:open, or REUSABILITY:restricted or REUSABILITY:permission. These are shortcuts for the lengthy queries. We keep the interface (and the URL) clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore this on the Portal: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" title=\"Europeana portal\">europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana API</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the API we introduced the ”reusability” parameter with the same options as in the portal: \"open\", \"restricted\" and \"permission\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example API call: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=%5BYOUR%20API%20KEY%5D&amp;query=*%3A*&amp;reusability=open\">http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=%5BYOUR%20API%20KEY%5D&amp;query=<em>%3A</em>&amp;reusability=open</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore this in the API console: <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/\" title=\"Europeana APi console\">labs.europeana.eu/api/console/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Further information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For details of how this is implemented, including the actual Solr queries, read my original blog post at <a href=\"http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana\">http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the Europeana Data Model see <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\" title=\"Europeana Data Model\">http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation</a> To find out more about the Europeana API check the extensive online documentation section at <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/\" title=\"Europeana API documentation\">http://labs.europeana.eu/api/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Péter Király, April 2014 <a href=\"http://nl.linkedin.com/in/peterkiraly/\">http://nl.linkedin.com/in/peterkiraly/</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2014-07-16-2nd-Europeana-Creative-Challenge-workshop.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This blog post has been created to support the <a href=\"/events/2nd-Europeana-Creative-Challenge-workshop-Barcelona/\">Europeana Creative Challenge workshop, Barcelona, 16 July 2014</a>, held in association with Apps&amp;Cultura. For those not able to attend, the event will be livestreamed at <a href=\"http://xmpp.iglor.es/appscultura_europeanalab/\">http://xmpp.iglor.es/appscultura_europeanalab/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This post is also a place where anyone interested in the challenges can post ideas and requests related to the API and the Challenge - just <a href=\"#comments\">add a comment</a> below and we'll respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You should find everything you need to get started using the Europeana API in the Europeana Labs website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New to Europeana?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>explore our <a href=\"/data\">sample datasets</a> to see examples of just some of the openly licensed content that is available</li>\r\n    <li>get inspiration from our <a href=\"/apps\">gallery of existing apps</a> to see what is possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>New to the Europeana API?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>if you haven't already done so, <a href=\"/api/registration/\">register for a Europeana API key</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>take a little time to read the <a href=\"/api/introduction/\">Getting Started guide</a> to the Rest API.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Give it a try</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>our <a href=\"/api/console/\">API Console</a> allows you to easily build and test queries</li>\r\n    <li>there are a number of client libraries available for languages such as php, Python and Django</li>\r\n    <li>we have also produced a <a href=\"/apps/#tag=open-source-tools\">directory of open source tools</a> that might be useful to developers, covering topics such as metadata management, annotation, front end display etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Collaborate</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>we're always keen to facilitate collaborations between developers, and with our own team. A great example is the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/europeana-open-culture/\">Europeana Open Culture app for iOS and Android</a> which has been released as an open source platform for building tablet-based experiences using Europeana content. It's <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki\">available on GitHub</a> under the \"European Union Public Licence\".</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Need help?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions, just leave a comment below or check out the <a href=\"/support/contact/\">other ways to contact us</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hints &amp; tips</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Querying by location</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>you can very easily specify a bounding box to query geotagged items. The easiest way to do this is via the <a href=\"/api/console/\">API Console</a> and enter coordinates in the 'Spatial params' filter</li>\r\n    <li>to include non-geotagged items you can run standard text searches based on place names. These will naturally be less precise, but if you can't find what you want, or are getting a lot of unrelated items, experiment with 'where' and 'what' searches e.g. <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=where:barcelona&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24\">where: Barcelona</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=what:barcelona&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24\">what: Barcelona</a> (note that the former method will typically retrieve items located in Barcelona (e.g. from Barcelona-based collections), the latter typically items depicting Barcelona.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Licensing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All metadata in Europeana is licensed as CC0 so is free to re-use. Individual items each have their own clearly marked license.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>the simplest way to find openly re-usable content is to use the parameter <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=Barcelona&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=minimal&amp;reusability=open\">&amp;reusability=open</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>more information about the different licenses and how to query them is contained in the blog post <a href=\"/blog/can-i-use-it/\">Can I use it?</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Retrieving media assets</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very common question from developers, so here's a quick overview and a few details about what can and what can't (currently at least) be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>every item returned in a standard search call will have a url to a thumbnail e.g. \"edmPreview\": [ \"http://europeanastatic.eu/api/image?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcoleccionfff.unav.es%2Fbvunav%2Fi18n%2Fcatalogo_imagenes%2Fimagen_id.cmd%3FidImagen%3D10000592&amp;size=LARGE&amp;type=IMAGE\" ] (note that if we have not been able to create a thumbnail, for example if the item is not an image, then a placeholder thumbnail will be returned)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>in addition, each item <strong>may</strong> have a direct link to the original media file. This is returned in the edmIsShowBy attribute (<strong>currently</strong> only available through an individual record call so you would need to iterate through each item in the search results - we currently have a new 'rich' profile in development that will return this attribute within the search results)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>you can query just for records that have such links by using &amp;query=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy:* in your API call</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>because of variability in the types of items and in the data supplied by providers, the format of these original files will vary (for example various image formats, pdfs, audio &amp; video files, and links to html pages with image viewers). If you wanted to use this attribute for example to display high resolution images your code should first detect and check the format.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of work is being undertaken to address this and provide a more direct and precise way of retrieving original media, but as illustrated by sites like <a href=\"http://www.zenlan.com/collage/europeana/#barcelona\">Culture Collage</a> and <a href=\"http://museums.eu/museum/details/16007/the-british-library\">museums.eu</a>, and the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/europeana-open-culture/\">Europeana Open Culture mobile app</a>, rich experiences can still be created using the thumbnails alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our data, API and associated documentation are constantly updated and improved. Much of this is in response to feedback and requests received from our user community. However big or small, we would love to hear of your plans and answer any questions you may have.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Send us your ideas</li>\r\n    <li>Consult us for tips</li>\r\n    <li>Ask us to test</li>\r\n    <li>Tell us your needs</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Leave a comment below, or see some of the other ways to <a href=\"/support/contact\">contact us</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But whatever you do</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ecreativechallenges2014.istart.org/\">enter the Europeana Creative Challenge</a></li>\r\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Header image: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_1896_A_19368_1959.html?start=8&amp;query=barcelona&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qf=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy%3A*&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3ARijksmuseum&amp;rows=24\">Opstand in Barcelona, 1640, Johann David Zunnern, 1701</a> from Rijksmuseum (Public Domain).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"comments\"></a></p>"

It’s a place for inspiration, innovation and sharing. Designed for our developer community, and driven by the feedback we received from you, we launched the Beta version back in April 2014 and have worked hard since then to refine the site to address the needs of our diverse and ever growing userbase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one place, you’ll now find everything from practical support through to inspirational apps and content:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the home for our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/\">API documentation</a> and the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/\">API console</a> where you can experiment with API calls.</li>\r\n    <li>There are examples of <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=client-library\">client libraries</a> and 50 selected <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=open-source-tools\">open source tools</a> that will help developers quickly build new apps using the Europeana API and content.</li>\r\n    <li>You’ll find <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/\">featured datasets</a>, selected to showcase providers who have supplied high quality, openly licensed, re-usable content.</li>\r\n    <li>Our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/\">apps gallery</a> aims to inspire new ideas by featuring the wide range of existing applications.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We will now be concentrating on adding regular blog posts, events and yet more openly licensed datasets and inspirational apps. If there’s anything you’d like to see, just <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/support/contact/\">let us know</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\n<h2>Focus on World War One</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is no surprise that amongst Europeana’s 33 million objects, provided by over 2,300 institutions across Europe, there is a great deal of rich and often unique World War One related material. As with all Europeana content, this is directly accessible through the Europeana API. There’s no better illustration of this than the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana 1914-18 website</a> which is directly powered by the API. It delivers over 350,000 searchable records, including images, text, audio and video. A unique aspect of these records is that they contain more than 130,000 items submitted by members of the public in the form of 10,000 personal stories, including photographs, diaries and war-related memorabilia. With most available under an open CC BY-SA license, there are some wonderful opportunities for creative re-use through the API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some example queries to get you started - browse the content through the Europeana Portal, or take a look at how you can retrieve these records for your own app through the API console:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Over 10,000 user contributed stories: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?count=12&amp;page=1&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;qf%5Bindex%5D=c\">Browse stories</a> | <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=%28%22world%2Bwar%2BI%22+OR+%221914-1918%22%29&amp;qf=UGC%3Atrue\">Browse items</a> | <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;qf=(%22world+war+I%22)%20OR%20(%221914-1918%22)&amp;qf=UGC:true&amp;profile=minimal&amp;reusability=open\">API console</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>The Somme in WW1: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=Somme&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=%28%22world%2Bwar%2BI%22+OR+%221914-1918%22%29\">Browse items</a> | <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=somme&amp;qf=(%22world+war+I%22%20OR%20%221914-1918%22)\">API console</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>A small selection of openly licensed video and audio clips: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;qf=TYPE%3AVIDEO&amp;qf=TYPE%3ASOUND&amp;qf=%28%22world%2Bwar%2BI%22%29+OR+%28%221914-1918%22%29&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen\">Browse items</a> | <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;qf=(%22world+war+I%22)%20OR%20(%221914-1918%22)&amp;qf=TYPE:VIDEO%20OR%20TYPE:SOUND&amp;profile=minimal&amp;reusability=open\">API console</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>API news</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our development team is constantly working to enhance the features available to access our content.

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/140328-introduction-blog-post.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have recently released a new translation method in the Europeana API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the multilingual nature of the Europeana content, it's always been an ambition to provide tools that ensure that a simple search will retrieve objects from collections with metadata in different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>translateQuery.json is a wrapper that uses the Wikipedia API to return suggested translations in user-defined langauges and constructs the query syntax to then use in a standard search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sample API call would be</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://europeana.eu/api/v2/translateQuery.json?languageCodes=en,de,fr,it,es&amp;wskey=xxxxxx&amp;term=butterfly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>which returns a json response that includes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"translatedQuery\":\"Butterfly OR Tagfalter OR Rhopalocères OR Farfalla\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users would then place that query string into a standard <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/\">search.json</a> call, which in this case adds over 500 records to the results compared to a simple search for just 'butterfly'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Languages should be defined using the two-letter codes according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes\">ISO 639-1 standard</a>. All we ask is that you don't run search queries with more than about 6 'OR' options as that puts quite a strain on our server!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further documentation will be provided, but in the meantime there's some further detail in our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/changelog/#v2translatequeryjson\">changelog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same methodology has been employed on our own search portal, and you can find more about the background to this on our blog - <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2014/08/improving-search-across-languages/\">Improving search across languages</a></p>"

        title: 'Hunting for First World War data - CENDARI and the Europeana API'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/CENDARI-and-the-Europeana-API.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By Valentine Charles (EuropeanaFoundation) and Milica Knezevic (Mathematical Institute SANU)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cendari.eu/\">The CENDARI project</a> is building a virtual research environment integrating resources from libraries and archives for medieval and First World War studies. The project is currently gathering relevant data related to the First World War to feed the knowledge base it is currently developing. These data are re-used in a set of domain ontologies and named-entity recognition tools developed to assist the research of historians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana API offers a large dataset related to First World War, gathering resources from <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">national collections</a> and <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\">film archives</a>, and also exceptional <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">primary resources collected from the public</a>. Collections relevant to the First World War were selected by CENDARI. The list contains a total of 289,453 records from 49 collections, out of the 33 million records available in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to connect the CENDARI repository with the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/introduction/\">Europeana API</a>, and to provide a mechanism to bring relevant content from Europeana into CENDARI, a script has been created which fetches records via the Europeana API, performs additional processing, and sends processed content to the CENDARI repository. The import process involves several phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first phase consists is collecting unique identifiers of the records from the selected collection. Since a collection may consist not only of records related to the First World War, but can mix different subjects, it is necessary to apply an additional filter in order to get only relevant records. The filter which should be added to the search query is “world war I” OR “1914-1918”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance: To filter data relevant for WW1 out of 170,596 records in collection 08547_Ag_EU_ATHENA_Zuse-Institute_Berlin, the following search query is used</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&amp;query=europeana_collectionName:08547_Ag_EU_ATHENA_Zuse-Institute_Berlin&amp;qf=%22world+war+I%22+OR+%221914-1918%22\">http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxx&amp;query=europeana_collectionName:08547_Ag_EU_ATHENA_Zuse-Institute_Berlin&amp;qf=%22world+war+I%22+OR+%221914-1918%22</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The second phase consists of retrieving data for the records gathered in the first stage. Each record can be fetched via the API in two formats, JSON and RDF (in accordance with the Europeana Data Model (EDM) http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation). Three resources are created in the CENDARI repository for each Europeana record. They correspond to the JSON representation of a record, a record in RDF format, and the original digital object. While the first two are downloaded and stored in the CENDARI repository, the third is only linked to the object at the original location given by the data provider, and not stored or cached locally, so that potential copyright issues are avoided. Original grouping of records which exist in Europeana are preserved to provide CENDARI users with an easy way to browse within a selected Europeana collection. In order to improve the quality of search on imported data, for each record the following information is extracted, if present: data provider, Europeana identifier, dc:source, dc:type, dc:subject, and dc:creator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment of writing, CENDARI has imported 22,600 EDM records. The data will be re-used within the CENDARI environment to feed the knowledge base currently developed by the project. These data will be made available to historians through various means (named-entity recognition tool, ontologies) in order for them to directly re-use these data in their research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall impression is that the Europeana API is well documented and easy to use. Thanks to the Europeana API tech team, there is <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/europeanaapi\">a responsive forum</a> for sharing ideas and suggestions, solving issues and answering questions related to the API. Note that there is a standard request limit 10,000 per day but it can be significantly increased for a single API key in specific cases (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/europeanaapi/FLh81ZbpLC0). It can also be worth noting and of interest for other API users that, although it is not currently specified in the documentation, we were able to get not only the JSON representation of the records, but also the original RDF (e.g. <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/api/v2/record/9200196/BibliographicResource_3000005913596_source.rdf?wskey=api2demo\">http://europeana.eu/api/v2/record/9200196/BibliographicResource_3000005913596_source.rdf?wskey=xxxxxx</a>)</p>"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2014-10-28-what-are-you-wearing.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By Gregory Markus, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Who are you wearing? Who are you wearing?\" This is a common phrase yelled at celebrities during red carpet events, be it the Academy Awards, Grammys, etc. But, no one is asking these people what open source tools they’re using. Rightly so, they probably aren’t using any, or perhaps they unknowingly are. For example, Spotify was built using <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/third-party-licenses/\">a dozen open source tools</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to ask you, our experts who develop, use, expand, and improve these tools, to talk about who you’re using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think it is time to give developers in the digital cultural heritage sector the spotlight; to share their favourite open sources tools to use, open source applications that they have developed, and to talk about what they would like to see developed in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our new series for the Europeana Labs blog, we'd like you to send us answers to these four questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>What open source tools are you currently working with?</li>\r\n    <li>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</li>\r\n    <li>What are you currently developing?</li>\r\n    <li>What would you like to see developed?</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re looking for more open source tools, be sure to check out our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=open-source-tools\">featured open source tools</a> in our Apps showcase, and also over 250 entries in the full <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">#FLOSS Directory</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to be featured, please e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a></p>"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2014-11-04-europeana-creative-design-challenge.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Creative is pleased to announce its final challenge encouraging you to design and submit products, applications and designs that reuse Europeana content in the theme of Design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Design Challenge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the Europeana Creative Design Challenge is to engage designers, artists, developers and entrepreneurs to explore and experiment with with cultural heritage content available in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We challenge ingenious minds and makers to rethink and redesign our common culture, and produce innovative and novel interpretations that make use of digital cultural content and data sourced from Europeana. The Europeana API allows you to access 2000+ collections and incorporate them into apps, games, products and websites. You can even create mash-ups when connecting Europeana's API with other sources or APIs. The possibilities are endless!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge opened on the 30th October and online submissions are welcome until 15th January, 2015 at 20h00 CET via <a href=\"http://ecreativedesign2015.istart.org/\">http://ecreativedesign2015.istart.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What should you create?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome a wide range of works for the Challenge, and appreciate contemporary and creative approaches to the digital cultural heritage materials. For example, including but not limited to results of digital fabrication, media art, design objects, web/mobile applications and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please keep in mind that the submitted works must re-use materials that are sourced through Europeana. Please also check the license of the content, making sure that re-use for your project context is allowed. To make things easier, discoverherereusable content available in both the Europeana portal and API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give you some more concrete idea of works that could be made using the Europeana content, below are some examples. These are meant as examples only, so let your inspiration run free and propose new innovative ideas:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Make a fabric print using pictures from a museum</li>\r\n    <li>Create an installation using audiovisual media from archives</li>\r\n    <li>Program a piece that generates algorithmic music from old sound recordings</li>\r\n    <li>3D print contemporary designs based on old objects</li>\r\n    <li>Design an app that remixes old paintings</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Where to find content and inspiration?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to help inspire you Europeana Creative has developed a pilot application to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content and a little bit of imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture Cam has been developed by partnersSpild af Tid&amp;AIT - Austrian Institute of Technologyas the design theme pilot; a “live” digital similarity tool that takes you on a playful journey into the fascinating collections within Europeana by using your web camera. You can easily scan an object, and Culture Cam captures and analyzes it and comes up with search results of similar color, shape or pattern. This pilot is still in its demo phase so please watch this space for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To discover further pilots that have been developed over the course of the project (in natural history and history education, social networks and tourism) clickhere. Ideas and examples of creative re-use are also available on the Europeana Creativeblog. Find out about our previous Challenge winners from the1stand2ndRounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore Europeana Labs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, why not exploreEuropeana Labs? This platform sets out to provide everything needed to get started using the Europeana APIs to develop apps and re-use digitised cultural heritage objects. You can learn about the data, see what others have created and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects, which include books, art and artefacts, audio clips and more. To make things easier, discoverreusable contentavailable in both the Europeana portal and API. If you would like additional support in finding suitable content, accessing digital objects, license conditions or anything else connected to Europeana please don’t hesitate to contact api@europeana.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entry Criteria</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Creative Design Challenge is open to any private, public or non-profit organisation within the EU or EFTA.

The old version of TimelineJS loaded a full copy of jQuery, which was kind of heavyweight, and sometimes lead to version collision problems when people embedded a Timeline in their own webpage. For the new version (and for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstorymap.knightlab.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU6NxfIo5a9z-Vf69lI9584DNtBQ\">StoryMapJS</a> which we developed last year), we instead copied a small portion of code from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fzeptojs.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5pApqK9qmEX2XQqpB1yvFKLLcA\">Zepto library</a>, just to handle all of the cross-browser, cross-server complexity of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajax-cross-domain.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSjh5o6IzHBJproNf8L7kg5HpK1A\">AJAX</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We always prefer open source tools, so the laundry list is long, and in some ways maybe not surprising: we use python for all of our server side code, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSU1ZCMW_LBb5E3mdq2QDIAj8M4g\">Django</a> or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fflask.pocoo.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ9V-_HcnDs2ho4QdgKcuzcvyZwA\">Flask</a> for web applications as appropriate. We also use the Fabric python library for build and deployment management, including with our javascript tools. We use lots of python libraries like requests, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftweepy%2Ftweepy&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSUaF2d7LZ02-QehsnAEbfcBKu_g\">tweepy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crummy.com%2Fsoftware%2FBeautifulSoup%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG_jrlLUcKe_OXToO3kMM5eF3JeQ\">Beautiful Soup</a>, and on and on. We use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHTmFHYKsnZbVKD3XP7-6c8QSVtg\">Ubuntu</a> for our servers, and on them we run <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhttpd.apache.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnE18Zqwca67qcEKHyyk34gCmIlQ\">Apache HTTPD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.postgresql.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzaJ-8YMyDLrJqiVWLkFFrmcbGVQ\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongodb.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbhl-87RwAJABHUobqyutVb2nFBg\">MongoDB</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elasticsearch.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmTzvbPsqT3LkchMsb1uaUdRjiig\">ElasticSearch</a>. We use common node tools like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flesscss.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyaG6OGCQoyYDFU5HHrHPcAFq0Jg\">LESS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmishoo%2FUglifyJS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoF2BJkPHAYiFfelQBjwQJPK4JbQ\">uglifyjs</a> for the javascript libraries. We don’t want people who want to use our software to have to buy other stuff to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are hoping that the new version of TimelineJS is slightly better factored to support community code contributions, although it’s also just hard to clearly communicate design intentions and priorities to a wider community. I know it’s frustrating when people develop a useful enhancement to an open source project which doesn’t get accepted by the core developers, but we’ve also found that a lot of people want to make TimelineJS do things that bend it away from our considered design choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a pretty different vein, we’ve been working on a toolkit for monitoring URL sharing on twitter, inspired by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.niemanlab.org%2Ffuego%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2I7bNLjt2q9iQcKZraY-_q5vT7g\">Nieman Lab’s Fuego</a>. Over the summer, we worked with one of their developers to create a new engine that does collection and indexing. People will still need some development skills to use that to publish a website. We’ll have a more formal announcement pretty soon, and we are looking forward to seeing what people build with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m not particularly looking for any tool or library. Rather, I’m interested in helping people become more fluent with information technology. It’s going to be cool when we can “read” computers like we read books, with almost no friction. Anything we can do to reduce that friction is interesting. I’m inspired by people like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTh0TIZahWolFwPo-IrAUvXTNy4w\">Bret Victor</a>, who push us to imagine<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2FMediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-AaA_E5YnffRNcTR1f_08-WuZJQ\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2FMediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-AaA_E5YnffRNcTR1f_08-WuZJQ\">media for thinking the unthinkable</a>, but I think there are a lot of incremental steps to get there. I’ll be happy if I can keep being part of thinking about that problem and making small steps forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like your work profiled in this column contact Gregory Markus at <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more open source tools see the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">FLOSS Inventory</a></p>"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/whos-using-what-eero-hyvonen.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this new series \"Who's Using What?\", <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech\">EuropeanaTech</a> Community Manager Gregory Markus from the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, will be profiling the use of open source software within the EuropeanaTech Communty and the greater digital cultural heritage world at large. Software will range from storytelling tools that enable reuse to OCRs or libraries and everything in between. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Eero Hyvönen</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/u/eahyvone/\">Eero Hyvönen</a> directs the Semantic Computing Research Group <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/\">SeCo</a> at Aalto Universiy, Finland. Since 2002, a major goal and research theme in SeCo has been creating a national Semantic Web infrastructure in Finland based on ontologies and ontology and data services. In this work, Cultural Heritage Linked Data has been a major application domain and many applications of SeCo are now in use, such as <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/museumfinland/\">MuseumFinland</a>; (2004), <a href=\"http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/?lang=en\">CultureSampo</a>; (2008), <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/kirjasampo/\">BookSampo</a>; (2011) of Finnish Public Libraries, and <a href=\"https://onki.fi/\">ONKI</a> (2008) <a href=\"http://finto.fi/fi/\">Finto</a>; (2014) ontology service of the National Library of Finland. Using and creating Open Source tools and Linked Open Data has been a long tradition in SeCo. He has published over 300 research articles and books in addition to winning the Semantic Web Challence Award (twice) and several other awards. We are pleased to feature Mr. Eero Hyvönen in our latest addition of \"Who's Using What?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our infrastructure is based on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/\">W3C Semantic Web</a> ;standards and on thesauri, gazetteers, and data sources already in use in Finland. At the moment we use, e.g.,<a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\">Jena</a> <a href=\"http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/\">Fuseki</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.varnish-software.com/\"> Varnish</a> for the “7-star” <a href=\"http://www.ldf.fi/\">Linked Data Finland</a> data service and <a href=\"http://light.onki.fi/fi/\">ONKI Light</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos\">Skosmos</a> for ontology services, <a href=\"http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/silk/\">Silk </a>and <a href=\"http://sieve.wbsg.de/\">Sieve </a>for data aligning,<a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_0_3/fileformats.html\">Lucene</a> for data indexing and searching, <a href=\"http://laurensrietveld.nl/yasgui/\">YASGUI for SPARQL</a> querying, <a href=\"http://protege.stanford.edu/\">protégé</a> for ontology editing, LODE and <a href=\"http://vocab.at/\">vocab.at</a> for dataset documentation, and <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> , <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a>, <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">D3.js</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev.data2000.no/sgvizler/\">Sgwizler</a> for user interfaces and visualizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also quite a few Open Source tools that we have used in larger applications before, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, <a href=\"http://spring.io/\">Spring</a>, and <a href=\"http://tapestry.apache.org/\">Tapestry </a> as web development frameworks, and <a href=\"http://www.swi-prolog.org/\">SWI Prolog</a> for logic programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the tooling side, the <a href=\"http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/las/\">SeCo Lexical Analysis Service</a> combines various open source language technology tools into a web service, and <a href=\"http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/eswc2014pd_submission_46.pdf\">SPARQL SAHA</a> makes use of them for automatic annotation and data curation. Aether is a tool for analyzing Linked Data dynamics, <a href=\"https://github.com/rvagg/csv2\"> csv2whatever</a> is a tool for data transformations, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jiemakel/snapper\">Snapper </a>is a browser-based Turtle editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For linked data and ontology creation, publishing, and reuse, the Linked Data Finland platform is being developed further and is combined with various tools for a comprehensive Linked Data publishing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Application prototypes being developed at the moment include <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/publications/\">Semantic National Biography</a> for enriching and linking over 6300 of short life stories on the Semantic Web,<a href=\"http://www.ldf.fi/dataset/finlex\"> Semantic Finlex</a> for publishing and using Finnish legislation as a Linked Data service, and WarSampo for publishing historical datasets as Linked Data related to WW1 and WW2. We collaborate with historians in Stanford University, University of Oxford, and Colorado University Boulder regarding representing and visualizing history as Linked Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Web of Data, based on RDF and complicated semantics, requires collaboration and mutual agreements and standards between data publishers and users. When one creates data, one should also think, how it will link with the other parties’ data around, otherwise problems will arise later. Problems, that could have been prevented by collaboration and using a shared Semantic Web infrastructure and services. Albert Einstein’s saying “Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them” has been a motto in our work, aiming creating a sustainable, cross-domain Semantic Web infrastructure and applications in Finland, compatible with international developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like your work profiled in this column contact Gregory Markus at <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more open source tools see the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">FLOSS Inventory</a></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2014-11-25-food-and-drink-challenge.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/\">first Europeana Food &amp; Drink challenge</a> invites applicants to submit innovative tools, products and services using food and drink themed content from Europeana. Here we highlight ways to access content, and outline techniques that you can use to discover more via Europeana's API.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Example content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Portal provides an easy, visual way to manually source content for your app. Try things like <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=cookbooks+OR+recipes&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qt=false\">cookbooks or recipes</a>, <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=%22drinking+song%22&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qt=false\">drinking songs</a> or <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=cup+OR+glass&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qt=false\">cups and glasses</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these searches are based on openly licensed material, but if your use is non-commercial this opens up even more possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see some specific examples of what you might find, we've compiled <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zs_B-xOiQ2faCHR4vSPYdAPQvN84uph4WDImNNgF0E4/edit?usp=sharing\">a list of around 30 top openly licensed images</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using the Europeana API</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You should find everything you need to get started using the Europeana API in the Europeana Labs website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New to Europeana?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>explore our <a href=\"/data\">sample datasets</a> to see examples of just some of the openly licensed content that is available</li>\r\n    <li>get inspiration from our <a href=\"/apps\">gallery of existing apps</a> to see what is possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>New to the Europeana API?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>if you haven't already done so, <a href=\"/api/registration/\">register for a Europeana API key</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>take a little time to read the <a href=\"/api/introduction/\">Getting Started guide</a> to the Rest API.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Give it a try</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>our <a href=\"/api/console/\">API Console</a> allows you to easily build and test queries</li>\r\n    <li>there are a number of client libraries available for languages such as php, Python and Django</li>\r\n    <li>we have also produced a <a href=\"/apps/#tag=open-source-tools\">directory of open source tools</a> that might be useful to developers, covering topics such as metadata management, annotation, front end display etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Hints &amp; tips</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using the translation API</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to look for content from across Europe but don't know the word for beer in Swedish, or for sausage in Italian? The <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/new-translation-method-in-API/\">Europeana translation API</a> uses Wikipedia to provide translated terms in many European langauges, returning a search string that you can use directly in our standard search API method. You need to specify your term, and the list of languages that you want results for (up to a maximum of about 6 for performance reasons).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>http://europeana.eu/api/v2/translateQuery.json?languageCodes=en,de,fr,it,es,sv&amp;wskey=api2demo&amp;term=beer\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>whose response includes</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\"translatedQuery\": \"beer OR \\\"Beer\\\" OR \\\"Öl\\\" OR \\\"Cerveza\\\" OR \\\"Birra\\\" OR \\\"Bier\\\" OR \\\"Bière\\\"\"\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting this into a standard search gives over 47,000 results, compared with 29,500 if you search for beer alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&amp;query=beer%20OR%20\\%22Beer\\%22%20OR%20\\%22%C3%96l\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Cerveza\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Birra\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Bier\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Bi%C3%A8re\\%22&amp;start=1&amp;rows=20&amp;profile=rich\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about the tranlsation API on our previous blog post http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/new-translation-method-in-API/</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Licensing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All metadata in Europeana is licensed as CC0 so is free to re-use. Individual items each have their own clearly marked license.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>the simplest way to find openly re-usable content is to use the parameter <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=Barcelona&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=minimal&amp;reusability=open\">&amp;reusability=open</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>more information about the different licenses and how to query them is contained in the blog post <a href=\"/blog/can-i-use-it/\">Can I use it?</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Retrieving media assets</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very common question from developers, so here's a quick overview and a few details about what can and what can't (currently at least) be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>every item returned in a standard search call will have a url to a thumbnail e.g. \"edmPreview\": [ \"http://europeanastatic.eu/api/image?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcoleccionfff.unav.es%2Fbvunav%2Fi18n%2Fcatalogo_imagenes%2Fimagen_id.cmd%3FidImagen%3D10000592&amp;size=LARGE&amp;type=IMAGE\" ] (note that if we have not been able to create a thumbnail, for example if the item is not an image, then a placeholder thumbnail will be returned)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>in addition, each item <strong>may</strong> have a direct link to the original media file. This is returned in the edmIsShowBy attribute, but note that you <strong>must</strong> set <code>&amp;profile=rich</code> to have these returned in standard search results.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>you can query just for records that have such links by using <code>&amp;qf=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy:\\*</code> in your API call</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>because of variability in the types of items and in the data supplied by providers, the format of these original files will vary (for example various image formats, pdfs, audio &amp; video files, and links to html pages with image viewers). If you wanted to use this attribute for example to display high resolution images your code should first detect and check the format.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of work is being undertaken to address this and provide a more direct and precise way of retrieving original media, but as illustrated by sites like <a href=\"http://www.zenlan.com/collage/europeana/#barcelona\">Culture Collage</a> and <a href=\"http://museums.eu/museum/details/16007/the-british-library\">museums.eu</a>, and the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/europeana-open-culture/\">Europeana Open Culture mobile app</a>, rich experiences can still be created using the thumbnails alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collaborate</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>we're always keen to facilitate collaborations between developers, and with our own team. A great example is the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/europeana-open-culture/\">Europeana Open Culture app for iOS and Android</a> which has been released as an open source platform for building tablet-based experiences using Europeana content. It's <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki\">available on GitHub</a> under the \"European Union Public Licence\".</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Need help or have something to share?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions, just leave a comment below or check out the <a href=\"/support/contact/\">other ways to contact us</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our data, API and associated documentation are constantly updated and improved. Much of this is in response to feedback and requests received from our user community. However big or small, we would love to hear of your plans and answer any questions you may have.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Send us your ideas</li>\r\n    <li>Consult us for tips</li>\r\n    <li>Ask us to test</li>\r\n    <li>Tell us your needs</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Enter the Challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Food &amp; Drink Challenge gives you a chance to pitch your app against other Europeana developers and the opportunity to win 5,000 €</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/\">enter the Europeana Food &amp; Drink Challenge</a>, closing date 20 December 2014.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Header image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_868.html?start=1&amp;query=cornelisz+kitchen&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">Pieter Cornelisz van Rijck, Kitchen Scene with the Parable of the Rich Man and Poor Lazarus, 1610 – 1620</a> from Rijksmuseum (Public Domain).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"comments\"></a></p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Douglas Duhaime Developer Profile'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2015-01-22-whos-using-what-douglas-duhaime.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week’s “Who’s Using What” spotlight goes to <a href=\"http://douglasduhaime.com/\">Douglas Duhaime</a>; from the University of Notre Dame. Douglas’s research takes him to intersections of early modern natural philosophy and classical political economy in eighteenth-century literary works. Douglas has been pursuing the relationship between these two facets by using natural language processing techniques, running hand-written scripts on text data from <a href=\"http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home\">Early English Books Online</a>; (EEBO), <a href=\"http://gdc.gale.com/products/eighteenth-century-collections-online/\">Enlightenment Century Collections Online</a>; (EECO) and the <a href=\"http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/\">Philosophical Transactions</a>; looking to trace patterns in Enlightenment-era literary history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can follow Douglas on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/douglasduhaime\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/duhaime\">Github</a>, and DHcommons and gather more insight into his work on his <a href=\"http://douglasduhaime.com\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm currently working on a few different text mining projects, a few of which use libraries like <a href=\"http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/\">WEKA</a>; and <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>; for analysis and <a href=\"http://ggplot2.org/\">ggplot</a>; or <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/d3\">D3</a>; for visualization. Because a lot of my work revolves around natural language processing, tools like the <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml\">Stanford NLP Pipeline</a> , <a href=\"http://wordnet.princeton.edu/\">Princeton's WordNet</a>, and the <a href=\"http://snowball.tartarus.org/\">Snowball stemmer</a>; are standard resources. When working with early modern texts, I've also been using <a href=\"http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/vard/about/\">Vard2</a>; and the variant tables in the <a href=\"http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/\">MorphAdorner</a>; package for orthographical normalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A few of the tools I've built draw upon <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\">Selenium's</a>; browser automation framework--which handles well in Javascript and AJAX-rich environments--and <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/\">Whoosh's</a>; full text indexing functions. Almost everything I write draws upon <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/\">Python's Natural Language Tool Kit</a>; and BeautifulSoup at some point. When working on applications that require fuzzy string matching, I like to use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html\">difflib</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm working with others in the University of Notre Dame's Text Mining Working Group to develop an open source web service capable of identifying literary allusions in user-provided texts. The prototype runs custom algorithms against an SQLite database with a Django back-end, and uses many of the text processing libraries discussed above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to see a library capable of estimating the likelihood that a given text contains one or more simple ciphers (substitution or null, for instance). Such a resource would be highly useful in certain contexts. I also eagerly await both the <a href=\"http://emop.tamu.edu/\">EMOP</a>; team's OCR engine for early modern typography and a package capable of achieving high sentiment classification scores on older prose. Both will be very valuable tools.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Rein van ''t Veer Developer Profile'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2015-02-15-whos-using-what-rein-van-tveer.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week's Who's Using What Developer Profile spotlights Rein van 't Veer from the <a href=\"http://www.den.nl/english\">DEN Foundation</a> (Digital Heritage Netherlands, The Hague). Rein specializes in location and heritage projects. His projects focus on archeology, the Semantic Web, Geographical Information Systems, Server Administration and Infrastructure, making use of Linux, Python and Javascript. Rein was also formerly a field archaeologist. He has a research masters degree in archaeology from the University of Amsterdam. Let Rein tell you about the few but fantastic staple plus up and coming tools he's favoring. You can also check out his <a href=\"https://github.com/reinvantveer\">Github</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>##1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my work for the project <a href=\"http://erfgoedenlocatie.nl/\">Heritage &amp; Location</a> at <a href=\"http://www.den.nl/english\">DEN Foundation</a> (Digital Heritage Netherlands, The Hague) we focus more and more on Linked Data, and <a href=\"http://virtuos.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/\">Virtuoso Open Source</a> is my open source RDF store of choice for the moment. I think it is the best-performing single-server open source RDF store currently around, with a staggering amount of features. The open source versions limited to only one processor, but the performance on that single thread is pretty impressive. I haven't really tried it to any real scale though.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd like to make a big shout out for <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>/<a href=\"http://postgis.net/\">PostGIS</a>, the best spatial database solution available. The interoperability with so many tools and stack solutions is a marvel, the possibilities are simply endless and I can still can't believe my luck that such a versatile and powerful software package is freely available. GeoServer is another extensive suite for exposing spatial data (in PostGIS for example) with well-established protocols and formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm really excited about the historical geocoding service we're developing with Waag Society and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. It's based on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">NodeJs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.elasticsearch.org/\">ElasticSearch</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/pelias/pelias\">Pelias</a>, fantastic emerging technology. Especially after seeing some of <a href=\"https://www.google.fr/search?q=douglas+crockford#=douglas+crockford&amp;tbm=vid\">Douglas Crockford's speeches on Youtube</a>, I found that there is a new development field with NodeJS that really takes advantage of the benefits of JavaScript. Eventually, we're developing our historical geocoding service as a means for archives, libraries, museums and other heritage institutions for them to be able to geocode placenames that are long lost. It's in its earliest development stage at the moment, but at the end of the project we hope to provide a great enrichment service to the heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Spatial and semantic technologies are still too far apart - that's generally missing in the semantic web field at the moment: good performance and diverse functionality on the spatial front. I'm really looking forward to seeing continued development for <a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\">Apache Jena</a>. It has been around for quite a while now and I've used it 'indirectly' with <a href=\"https://github.com/AKSW/Sparqlify\">Sparqlify</a>. I hope they keep up the improvements and extend the spatial functionality to full GeoSPARQ specs.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Benjamin Rokseth Developer Profile'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2015-03-20-whos-using-what-benjamin-rokseth.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this edition of “Who’s Using What?” we head north to Oslo where Benjamin Rokseth is working with The Digital Development Team at the Oslo Public Library. The <a href=\"https://www.deichman.no/side/in-english\">Oslo Public Library</a> is currently in a transitional phase as they prepare for the grand opening of what will be an <a href=\"http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/\">astonishingly beautiful building</a> on the Oslo waterfront. But with a beautiful new building comes the need for a progressive CMS and a new and improved way for local visitors and researchers as well as internationals alike seeking to access the library’s collection. The Oslo Public Library decided to make a big change their new library system on the well known OSS, <a href=\"http://www.koha.org/\">Koha</a>. You can read all about the transition in <a href=\"http://digital.deichman.no/blog/2015/01/12/working-with-koha-at-oslo-public-library/\">this fascinating piece</a>. Rokseth is an OS champion and for any library’s looking to make the switch from an old CMS to Koha, hopefully his answers and insights will provide some guidance. For more info you can investigate his personal <a href=\"https://github.com/bensinober\">Github</a> and the <a href=\"http://digital.deichman.no/\">Digital Development Team’s blog</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/digibib\">Github</a> .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>##1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, our public library is migrating from a proprietary library system to the community driven Koha, which is open source in all respects. The main focus for the present is on the development workflow and continuous integration, and in that respect we use <a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org/\">Jenkins</a> as staging/integration tool and <a href=\"http://saltstack.com/\">SaltStack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> for the entire deployment/setup process. For functionality testing we use <a href=\"https://cukes.info/\">Cucumber</a>, and <a href=\"http://watir.com/\">Watir</a> for browser testing. Everything neat and open source.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, I have never used anything but open source, so the list would be too long to display. As long as there exists an open source alternative, it is to be preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the focus is on testing and continuous integration for the moment, we are not developing much at present. Mostly we focus on building APIs to integrate our various services to the Koha library system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are strongly encouraging a move towards linked data (RDF) in the public sector, so we would like to see a growth in developnt of open source tools to propagate this move. There are numerous alternatives, but we have yet to see a clear open source alternative for working with bibliographic metadata.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2015-04-15-food-drink-challenge-two.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Food and Drink Project is launching a competition for representatives from the Creative Industries, start-ups, and non-profit organizations from all EU member states. With the Challenge, we invite movie and video makers to create a <strong>video story</strong>, of <strong>max. 21 minutes length</strong>, showcasing the relation between <strong>sustainability of food and drink heritage</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. Inspired and supported by <a href=\"http://www.slowfood.com/sloweurope/en/\">Slow Food</a>, the focus is on aspects of biodiversity and sustainability reflected in European food and drink cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Second Open Innovation Challenge is based on a combination of three factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Pioneering <strong>innovative strategies</strong> and <strong>quality standards</strong> in video storytelling</li>\r\n    <li>Promoting <strong>linkage</strong> of cultural heritage and sustainable food / small food production</li>\r\n    <li>Improving <strong>methodologies for collaboration</strong> between Europeana and Creative Industries in the creation and re-use of digital content</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We <strong>challenge you</strong> to immerse yourself in the rich variety of the Europe’s regional food and drink culture, traditions, production and sustainability and to create a meaningful story from there. We <strong>encourage</strong> you to get involved with regional heritage centres and local libraries, archives or museums in order to find out interesting facts, figures and records to enrich your story with significant content or simply make use of the digital content available through Europeana. <a href=\"http%22//labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> highlights open content and provides extensive documentation on using the Europeana API, giving you access to hundreds of thousands of items for you to incorporate into your work. All films that fulfil the evaluation criteria will be made available in the Europeana platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The winning project will receive €3,000 in cash, and, this time, we’re offering more than just a cash prize as we will open up an international stage to present the best projects we receive. Selected videos will be presented in the Challenge Award Event on 22nd July 2015 at the Expo 2015 in Milan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Challenge opens on <strong>15th April 2015</strong> and your video projects can be submitted until <strong>20th June 2015</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further evaluation criteria, further guidelines, rules and instructions on how to apply, visit <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengetwo/\">foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengetwo/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image credit: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_C_106.html\">The Egg Seller, by Hendrick Bloemaert</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\" title=\"Public Domain marked\">Public Domain</a> from the Rijksmuseum.</p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/2015-03-22-whos-using-what-Sebastian-Hierl.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being inspired by our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/whos-using-what-benjamin-rokseth/\">last Who's Using What column</a>, we are proud to welcome Dr. Sebastian Hierl from the American Academy in Rome to our growing community of FLOSSers. Before becoming <a href=\"http://www.aarome.org/it/news/features/dr-sebastian-hierl-new-drue-heinz-librarian\">Drue Heinz Librarian of the Arthur &amp; Janet C. Ross Library</a>, Dr. Hierl was responsible for developing the <a href=\"http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/widener/collections/western_european.cfm\">Widener Library’s Western European collections at Harvard University</a>. Hierl is a strong supporter of Koha as an ILS (integrated library system) for its web-based interface and flexibility as well as the strong and growing community of instituions and developers. So without further ado, Dr. Sebastian Hierl from the American Academy in Rome!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The institutions of the Koha Gruppo Italiano, composed of the <a href=\"http://www.aarome.org/\">American Academy in Rome</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aur.edu/\">The American University of Rome</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.pusc.it/\">Pontificia Università della Santa Croce</a>, all use the Open Source ILS, Koha. We are among an increasing number of <a href=\"http://www.kohagruppoitaliano.moonfruit.com/koha-in-italy/4588271863\">Koha libraries in Rome and throughout Italy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Principally, we implemented Koha in our libraries and contributed to the development of select features and the resolution of \"bugs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently working with the Koha community and with <a href=\"https://www.ebscohost.com/\">EBSCO</a> on replacing the current Zebra search engine in Koha with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\">ElasticSearch</a>. The community, under the leadership of <a href=\"http://bywatersolutions.com/\">ByWater Solutions</a>, aims at providing ElasticSearch as an alternate search engine, thus offering a choice to all Koha libraries between Zebra and ElasticSearch. (Read more about the collaboration <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/news-center/press-releases/koha-receives-massive-support-from-ebsco-for-enhancements\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Italian Koha community, we would like to develop a search API integrating Koha with the Italian union catalogue, the <a href=\"http://www.sbn.it/opacsbn/opac/iccu/free.jsp\">OPAC catalogo SBN</a>, of the Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche. Such an integration would dramatically increase interest in Koha as an Open Source ILS in Italy. It would help all current Koha libraries in Italy and strengthen the entire Koha community. We further would like to see greater integration of linked data with Koha and our hope is that the current development with ElasticSearch will foster this development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/14668263631/\">The triumphal arch of Constantine, Rome, Italy</a> from Boston Public Library (No known copyright restrictions).</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs/blog/europeana-beacon.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Beacon is an exciting new project using iBeacon technology that is now seeking crowdfunding to help deliver a local discovery app to towns and cities across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeanabeacon.com/\">Europeana Beacon</a> project was started at <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.it/e/hack4pisa-registration-12152387117\">Hack4Pisa</a> in October 2014 by a team from local software company Oimmei. After winning the competition and impressing the judges, not just with their innovative idea but also their strong team, they went on to be finalists at the second Apps4Europe international business lounge at the <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\">Future Everything festival</a> in Manchester in February 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of Europeana Beacon is a mobile app that uses iBeacon technology to let users to discover local culture in new and immersive ways, and gives local landmarks the chance to speak for themselves! Pictures, videos or historical facts from Europeana are supplemented by content from local providers (town municipalities, tourism offices, and so on), who can also build rich, engaging experiences, including treasure hunts and quizzes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge the team now faces is to find the support and funding from local providers and fellow developers that will allow them to launch this as a platform that remains free to end users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simone Figlié, part of the Oimmei team behind the Europeana Beacon (eBe) project, writes: <em>“For all of this to happen we need the active participation of municipalities or local tourism offices who want to “beaconize” their cities, placing the beacons in the appropriate areas and providing good quality content. We wanted the app to be free for the end user - our main goal is for anyone to go to a city and discover its beauty at no cost - so we need funding for developing the platform. At FutureEverything 2015 in Manchester, we met with the great team from Goteo, who showed us the possibilities of crowdfunding.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The crowdfunding campaign</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Goteo and Oimmei have teamed up to launch a 40-day crowdfunding campaign to secure the development of Europeana Beacon - <a href=\"http://goteo.org/project/europeana-beacon\">http://goteo.org/project/europeana-beacon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals and local institutions can support this exciting project by simply following the link and selecting their contribution amount on the panel at the right. What’s more, every contribution will be matched by a funding institution (in this case, Spanish University UNIA), doubling all campaign contributions - but only if a campaign reaches its minimum goal by the 40-day time limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also higher contribution amounts linked with special rewards. Rewards are particularly aimed at early contributors within towns and cities and vary from access to the platform in the beta stage to funders’ involvement in development decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For developers around the world, the success of this crowdfunding campaign will mean that all the App UX/UI designs artworks, as well as the real assets used to develop the platform will be released as open source. The actual “Sketch” or “Photoshop” files will be available for anyone, so people can follow the flow of the Apps through entire views of artworks or export any single piece of artwork for their personal reuse. In addition, during all the development process, the Oimmei team will publish a “development diary” in blog form, discussing the main decisions they need to take as well as any technical hurdles or solutions they have to implement in order to successfully develop the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a href=\"http://goteo.org/project/europeana-beacon\">Support Europeana Beacon</a> and help this exciting app grow!</h3>"

For any developer or institution currently working on, or planning to manage such massive digital collections and succesfully re-present them to the global public, these three development teams combined hold an unprecedent amount of expertise and they do it all while using open source software. Read here what tools these teams are favouring, what they've made for the world to improve upon and use, and what they hope to see in the future. Up first, Chris McDowall and the development team from DigitalNZ!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 16px; line-height: 1.225; font-size: 1.75em; position: relative; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 0.3em; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif;\">Chris McDowall and DigitalNZ</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;\"><img alt=\"Digital New Zealand logo\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/whos-using-what-dnzlogo.jpg\">The National Library of New Zealand's <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">DigitalNZ</a> team makes New Zealand's digital content available to find, share and use. Like Europeana, DigitalNZ aggregates metadata from many digital collections so it is available to search and also encourages the development of new discovery experiences through an <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org/developers\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">open API</a>. The team works with the collections from a wide range of organisations across the cultural sector, community groups, businesses and media organisations. It also brings in metadata relevant to New Zealand from Europeana and DPLA. DigitalNZ is almost eight years old and its most recent development is the release of <a href=\"http://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">Supplejack</a>, an open source tool for aggregating, searching and sharing metadata records. Supplejack collects metadata about millions of items from hundreds of data sources. The tool transforms messy data, creates a unified search index and makes the reconciled metadata widely available via an open API data service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Segoe UI', Arial, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;\">Chris McDowall is the manager of DigitalNZ Systems.

For any developer or institution currently working on, or planning to manage such massive digital collections and succesfully re-present them to the global public, these three development teams combined hold an unprecedent amount of expertise and they do it all while using open source software. Read here what tools these teams are favouring, what they've made for the world to improve upon and use, and what they hope to see in the future. You can read our previous piece with, Chris McDowall and the development team from DigitalNZ <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/who-s-using-what-chris-mcdowall-and-digitalnz-developer-profile\">here</a>. But up now, Bram Lohman and the Europeana Development Team!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/logo-english-horses-landscape.png\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Europeana Foundation</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This interview was submitted by Europeana Development Lead, Bram Lohman</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana team consists of around 10 developers, ranging from back-end developers to front-enders, a sys-admin and tester. Our main developments are the <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/europeana.eu\">Europeana Portal</a> and the home-grown ingestion system called <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/uim-europeana\">UIM</a> (based on the OSGI framework), as well as several other tools to support our business needs (such as <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/REPOX\">REPOX</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a>). All of these can be found on our <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana\">GitHub</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of our back-end is in <a href=\"https://java.com/en/\">Java</a>, and we have a <a href=\"https://www.javascript.com/\">JavaScript</a> front-end, but in the near future there are major changes underway that will see us using other languages, such as <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-36\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-open-source-tools-are-you-currently-working-with\">What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To support our development process we use the ‘standard’ tools: <a href=\"https://jenkins-ci.org/\">Jenkins</a>, <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a>, <a href=\"http://junit.org/\">JUnit</a>, <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\">Apache Maven</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\">Selenium</a>, etc. The software itself uses <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>, <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Apache Solr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\">Apache Tomcat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudfoundry.org/index.html\">CloudFoundry</a>, <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">JQuery</a>, and a slew of other tools, too many to name.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-37\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-open-source-tools-have-you-used-in-the-past-to-develop-larger-applications\">What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We moved from <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion</a> to Git a while back, and although each developer has their own preference a lot are using the <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse IDE</a>. There is a a shift towards <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">IntelliJ</a>, but these flavours of IDE tend to change with the seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-38\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-are-you-currently-developing\">What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re revamping the Europeana Portal, basing it on <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\">Blacklight</a>, which is written in Ruby. We’re also nearly moving the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> into a beta release, which uses <a href=\"https://storm.apache.org/\">Apache Storm</a>/<a href=\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Apache Zookeeper</a>, <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/\">OpenStack Swift</a> amongst others.<br>\r\nWe’ve also “officialy” taken on REPOX (version 3 upwards, there are too many variations on earlier version to be able to support them), and have made major improvements on it. We’re integrating <a href=\"http://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a> in most of our software as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-39\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-would-you-like-to-see-developed\">What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a keen interest in <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/package-summary.html\">Android</a> here, although we don’t do any development of it ourselves. We’ll soon be tackling our ingestion workflow system to leverage the Europeana Cloud, so any open-source tools we can re-use for that would be very welcome.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"

Up next though, Mark Matienzo and the DPLA Development team!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/horizontal-logo-blue-withoutwhitebackground.jpg\" style=\"width: 1258px; height: 453px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Mark Matienzo and the DPLA</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Matienzo and the DPLA The <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">DPLA</a> has been making waves in the digital heritage sector since their official beginning in 2013. Their goal isn’t much different than Europeana’s, providing easy digital access to a large aggregated corpus of digitised heritage materials. DPLA built their <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/developers/map/\">Metadata Application Profile</a> (MAP) off of Europeana’s EDM and have subsequently collaborated with Europeana on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-principles-for-establishing-international-interoperable-righ\">International Rights Statements</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/developing-and-implementing-a-technical-framework-for-interopera\">putting them into action</a>. But what drew me to the DPLA was something I heard at EuropeanaTech 2015 in Paris. There, DPLA Director Dan Cohen said in his wonderful presentation that the DPLA development team names all their tools after goats because “they’re curious and consume everything”. Well those sounded like developers I needed to talk to. So without further ado, read our interview with Mark Matienzo from the DPLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://matienzo.org/\">Mark Matienzo</a> is the Director of Technology for the Digital Public Library of America. Prior to joining DPLA, Matienzo worked as an archivist and technologist specialising in born-digital materials and metadata management, at institutions including the Yale University Library, The New York Public Library, and the American Institute of Physics. Matienzo received a MSI from the University of Michigan School of Information and a BA in Philosophy from the College of Wooster, and was the first awardee (2012) of the Emerging Leader Award of the Society of American Archivists.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the current development work we’re doing is built using <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> database system, and <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Apache Solr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch</a> for indexing. For our metadata projects, such as to support ingestion and metadata enhancement, we’ve been using <a href=\"http://marmotta.apache.org/\">Apache Marmotta</a> as our triple store, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ActiveTriples/ActiveTriples\">ActiveTriples</a> to help with modeling RDF objects in Ruby code. We’re excited to start doing more with <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\">Blacklight</a> and <a href=\"http://projecthydra.org/\">Hydra</a> as well. We also use <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com/home\">Ansible</a> for deployment and automation, and <a href=\"https://www.redmine.org/\">Redmine</a> for tracking issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve used a variety of tools, including <a href=\"http://omeka.org/\">Omeka</a>, <a href=\"http://akara.info/\">Akara</a>, and some of the same previous tools mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All of DPLA’s current public projects are available on <a href=\"https://github.com/dpla\">our Github account</a>. Most of our work has been going towards <a href=\"https://digitalpubliclibraryofamerica.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/Heidrun\">Heiðrún</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dpla/KriKri\">Krikri</a> (parts of our new metadata ingestion system that’s been under development since October 2014). We’re also just beginning a project, called \"<a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2015/04/15/far-reaching-hydra-in-a-box-joint-initiative-funded-by-imls/\">Hydra in a Box</a>\", with Stanford University and DuraSpace, to develop a turnkey repository system built on the Hydra framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our largest need are high-performance storage and querying solutions for RDF data. We’re particularly excited about work going into <a href=\"http://linkeddatafragments.org/\">Linked Data Fragments</a>, but we’re hoping that there are more implementations that will be under way. We’d also like to see more convergence around developing shared metadata enhancement tools or common APIs for developing them, such as for geocoding and alignment of terms with authority files and vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the DPLA read Joris Pekel’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/looking-to-the-future-with-the-dpla-an-interview-with-dan-cohen\">interview with Dan Cohen from EuropeanaTech 2015</a>.</p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'We''ve relaunched Europeana Labs with greater focus, an improved product and better services, not to mention a new visual design.'
        body: "<p>Since April 2014, we’ve been working with culturally minded developers and cultural heritage institutions to make Europeana Labs the go-to place for practical resources for using and building with cultural collections. We’re delighted to say we’ve now relaunched the site with greater focus, an improved product and better services, not to mention a new visual design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s new with Europeana Labs?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s an overview of the improvements we’ve made:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improved API features and documentation</strong><br>\r\nBased on your feedback, we have updated and extended our three APIs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> has been extended with powerful features giving you the ability to search for and filter Europeana’s collections by what media files are directly available. For example, you can now retrieve just those records which have extra-large images, or maybe you're after high-quality audio files. Of course all these extra features can be combined with existing text, metadata and licensing filters. Read our <a href=\"/blog/new-media-search-methods-in-the-europeana-api\">'how to' guide</a> if you're a developer looking to access media files for your app, or <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">explore the Europeana Collections</a> to view and manually download individual items.</li>\r\n    <li>The <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Linked Open Data service</a> has been updated to provide access to over 45 million items. Explore, access and download metadata through the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-SPARQL-endpoint\" target=\"_blank\">SPARQL</a> endpoint provided by <a href=\"http://europeana.ontotext.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ontotext</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>The Europeana <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/oai-pmh-introduction\" target=\"_blank\">OAI-PMH Service</a> uses the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH v2.0). The service is currently in beta, which means that access to the service is limited. To use it, email api@europeana.eu</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We've also updated the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">documentation</a> for all three services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can provide feedback on our API services via our <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/europeana-lod\" target=\"_blank\">forum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More re-usable datasets </strong><br>\r\nOver <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data\" target=\"_blank\">80 datasets</a> give you access to more than one million openly licensed and directly accessible items. Refine them with a range of filters that now show the number of datasets in each category - for example you'll currently find 30 for ‘<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=history\">History</a>’ and 25 for ‘<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=photographs\">Photographs</a>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even more datasets will be added each month so keep coming back to see what’s new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stronger ‘Apps showcase’</strong><br>\r\nLabs now provides <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps\" target=\"_blank\">over 160 examples</a> of cultural heritage apps and tools, separated into three categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>‘Showcase’ gives you examples of apps, games and other creations that use the Europeana API to make use of Europeana collections.</li>\r\n    <li>‘Tools’ are specific tools for working directly with the Europeana API.</li>\r\n    <li>‘FLOSS’ are other open source tools relevant for digital cultural heritage developers.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Where possible, each entry includes links to relevant code and documentation.<br>\r\nAs with the datasets, you can refine the ‘Apps showcase’ using a range of filters, such as ‘Linked Open Data (8)’, or ‘Gaming (6)’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New incubation section </strong><br>\r\nAlthough we can’t provide financial assistance for the development of prototypes and concepts, we can provide a range of <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation\" target=\"_blank\">valuable support services</a>. Our new, simple incubation process can help you at every stage, from idea generation to market-ready product.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Somewhere to play - find the location of a physical lab near you that you can visit to experiment with digital cultural content, as well as build and test your prototypes.</li>\r\n    <li>Co-creation - when you’re in development mode, take a co-creation workshop to test variations, scenarios and feasibility of your prototype with our partner, Platoniq.</li>\r\n    <li>Crowdfunding - when you’re ready to bring your prototype to market, find alternative financing strategies, take a crowdfunding workshop and create a crowdfunding campaign.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Book a co-creation or crowdfunding workshop using our easy online form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Better communication</strong><br>\r\nTo help you make the most of Europeana Labs’ services, we’ll be talking to you more from now on. We’ll post more events and write more blogs. You can also sign up to <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bcPYL9\" target=\"_blank\">our newsletter</a> to get our news straight to your inbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don’t forget to share your own developments with us - send us an email <a href=\"http://mailto:api@europeana.eu\">api@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to know more about the work we’ve done on Europeana Labs? <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMEnG-0lwu7VpJV7c74NzxLX9d29qcW-8RdiLVycsD8/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Read a summary of the Europeana Labs’ business plan</a></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This blog was contributed by Hetty Blades and Rosemary Cisneros from Coventry University</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How might we ‘hack’ the dancing body? What tools can we use and develop upon in order to remix, recycle and reveal dance content, movements, and cognitive processes? These questions will be explored in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/hackathons/dance-hackathon/\">EuropeanaSpace Dance Hackathon</a>, which takes place in Prague on the 20th and 21st of November.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/dance-of-death.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 706px;\">How can you make this...</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dance Hackathon is a free two day event, bringing together people interested in dance, culture, computer programming and digital technologies. Participants will work in teams to experiment with ways of examining and reusing digital cultural content, focussing particularly on dance and the performing arts. They will work alongside a team of Hackathon ambassadors (experts in programming, BCI technologies, motion-tracking, and cultural heritage), explore new creative ideas, design and develop prototypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hackathon focuses on the re-use of cultural heritage materials in live performance, cross-media storytelling, motion tracking and transformation of data, brain/computer interfaces in performance. We encourage participants to combine different aspects of these elements to create something truly new and unique that will shake up the market!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teams will work across two venues, a digital media lab and <a href=\"http://www.ciant.cz/index.php/en/\">CIANT</a>, and a specialist dance studio, just around the corner at PUNCTUM. The two sites will be connected via GoPro cameras, allowing for cross-site interaction and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/golem-france-024.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 900px;\">...into this?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the two days the teams will present their ideas to an international jury of experts. The top three teams will be selected to attend a business modelling workshop in London hosted by <a href=\"http://www.remixsummits.com/\">REMIX</a>, where they can further develop their ideas. After the workshop the team with the strongest idea will win 3 months of incubation support from <a href=\"http://www.remixsummits.com/academy/\">REMIX Academy</a> and the EuropeanaSpace consortium. This event offers a great opportunity to explore the potential of technology to encourage creative engagement in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about the event, including how to register can be found <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/hackathons/dance-hackathon/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Hetty Blades: <a href=\"mailto:ac1417@coventry.ac.uk\">ac1417@coventry.ac.uk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images: \"T<a href=\"http://wellcomeimages.org/indexplus/image/V0041905.html\" target=\"_blank\">he Dances of Death</a>\" via the Wellcome Library CC-BY and CIANT</p>"

        title: 'Using the Europeana API - a beginners guide with jQuery'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'This short guide is intended to give a very simple overview of making an API call and displaying content on a web page using data from the response.'
        body: "<p>Here we explore a very simple example of making a Europeana API call and displaying results on a web page. It's aimed at beginners both to coding and to the Europeana API, but demonstrates the basic pricipals that can then be applied to other coding languages. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery\" title=\"jQuery\">jQuery</a> is the most widely used cross-platform JavaScript library, used to simplify client-side scripting. It's also handy to use for an example like this and at the end there's a link where you can see the results, get the code, and experiment further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly we have to set up an html page, include the jQuery library, and create a div where we will add our content. In its most basic form this could be:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;html&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;head&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;title&gt;Europeana Test Page&lt;/title&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/head&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;body&gt;<br><strong>&lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js\"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</strong><br>\r\n&lt;/body&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We're going to use the latest open dataset from the Austrian National Library - <a href=\"/data/vintage-photographs-of-vienna\">Vintage Photographs of Vienna</a> - as an example. If you follow the link from that dataset page to our API console you can <a href=\"/api/console?function=search&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200434*&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=rich\">see how to form an API call for that dataset</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxxxx&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200434*&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=rich</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll obviously need to use your own API key instead of <em>xxxxxxxx</em> and if you don't have one then <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/get-api\">sign up for an API key now</a>. You'll notice that we are requesting the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search#profile-parameter\"><em>rich</em> profile</a>, which means we'll get some extra things in our response, such as text descriptions and direct links to the high resolution images which are available for this particular dataset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we start our script with some code to make the API call, and create a function where we can then do something with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>var apiCall = 'https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200434*&amp;start=1&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=rich';</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$.getJSON(apiCall, function (json) {<br>\r\n// here we will do something with the response<br>\r\n});</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The response will now be available in an object called <em>json </em>with the same hierachical structure as shown in the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200434*&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=rich\">API console</a>. Or if you paste the api call into a browser you can view the hierarchy using an extension such as <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh\">JSON Viewer</a> (for the Chrome browser, but others are available).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/json-response.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we have our json and we know what it contains and we can start to extract the parts we want, for example the total number of records, and add them to our page.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>var totalcount = json.totalResults;<br>\r\nvar counthtml = '&lt;h2&gt;Total results: ' + totalcount + '&lt;/h2&gt;';<br>\r\n$('#content').append(counthtml);</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to see where we've got to? <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/jamesinealing/6wjxw88x/\">See this code working on jsFiddle</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get our actual items we need to create a loop that goes through them one by one. Because they're all stored in the <em>json</em> object, that's pretty simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>$.each(json.items, function (i, item) {<br>\r\n// we can now access object metadata in the object 'item'<br>\r\n});</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>What this will do is go through each item one by one (for this query that's 21 items) and let us extract elements from the metadata for each. So lets find the title, the link to Europeana, and the thumbnail image and create some html to display each thumbnail (with the title as the image alt tag), linked to the Europeana page. Again, referring to the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200434*&amp;rows=24&amp;profile=rich\">API console</a> for this API call can be useful to get the syntax for the element names - in this example we'll be using <em>title</em>, <em>guid</em> and <em>edmPreview</em>. When we've done all this, we mustn't forget to add the html to the page of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>var title = item.title;<br>\r\nvar link = item.guid;<br>\r\nvar thumbnail = item.edmPreview;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>var objecthtml = '';<br>\r\nobjecthtml += '&lt;a href=\"'+link+'\" title=\"'+title+'\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"'+thumbnail+'\" alt=\"'+title+'\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;';</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$('#content').append(objecthtml);</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Because we will place this in the <em>each </em>loop it will execute for all 21 items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is pretty much it. Of course this will just give a very simple display and you'll want to style it, but you can <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/jamesinealing/wu4628wk/\">see the final code on jsFiddle</a> and play with it as you wish!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally if you have any questions then do <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/person/james-morley\">get in touch</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Who''s Using What: Omeka'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'In this edition of "Who''s Using What?" we could not be more excited to showcase Omeka.'
        body: "<p>Omeka is perhaps the most well known and widely used open source web-publishing platform for libraries, museums, archives and storytelling enthusiast. Just take a look at <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Sites_Using_Omeka\">their Wiki </a>of past exhibitions that have made use of Omeka, it's extensive. Europeana used it for their digital <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/art-nouveau-en\">Art Nouveau exhibition</a>. Omeka started life in 2008 at the <a href=\"https://chnm.gmu.edu/\">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University and has been only getting better since. Let's see what tools the Omeka team are using to ensure that the platform is easy for others to build-upon, adapt and modify while retaining its strong core, and what their future plans are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This interview was submitted by Sharon Leon, Director of Public Projects at the Center for History and New Media and Director of Omeka. You can read more about Leon's work <a href=\"http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/sleon\">here</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/omeka-page.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Open Source Tools Do You Use / Have You Used?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://omeka.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Omeka\">Omeka</a> relies on a number of underlying technologies. Most fundamentally, Omeka is built on the <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zend Framework</a>. It provides a lot of functionality for us to use things like routing requests, a structure for building themes and plugins, and a codebase that lets us work within an existing set of patterns. To the extent that we do a good job of adhering to those patterns, that makes an easier onramp for others to extend Omeka and suggest fixes and improvements to the core of Omeka. Currently, we also incorporate the <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyMCE</a> editor for our text/HTML inputs, and have moved toward using more of the established javascript and CSS libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a> and <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SaSS</a>. As a big project, this lets us benefit from other FLOSS work focused on their own functionality, so we can concentrate on developing for the needs of our own user communitity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next generation of Omeka, <a href=\"https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/wiki\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Omeka S\">Omeka S</a>, continues to use Zend Framework, but also incorporates newer tools like the <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html\" target=\"_blank\">Doctrine</a> ORM. Besides modernizing the codebase, this similarly allows us to use the efficiencies of Doctrine to improve our site performance and manage data relationships. One of the main goals of Omeka S is to improve data sharing between Omeka and other GLAM tools. Openness and interconnectedness, generally understood, is built into the design of Omeka S. To that end, we are relying heavily on Linked Open Data serialized as <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON-LD</a>, and basing our API on that. It is designed to be \"multisite\", meaning that one installation will support many distinct sites for different purposes, similar to a WordPress network installation. Different from a WordPress network, though, content is designed to be shared at a fundamental level to be shared between sites. Explicit RDF-based relationships between resources in Omeka S will be possible. To supplement the linked data implementation with Omeka S, we are also in the process of building modules to integrate a range of standardized vocabularies such as those offered by the Getty Research Institute and the Library of Congress. When it is available, we are also planning to offer a module that includes the recent DPLA/Europeana <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2015/10/06/whitepapers-for-establishing-international-and-interoperable-rights-statements-released/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"international rights statements\">international rights statements standard</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see built?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We would love to see an open source Agile project management tool built on top of GitHub's API. Some (paid) services and products based on GitHub exist (<a href=\"https://waffle.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Waffle</a>, <a href=\"https://huboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HuBoard</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\">Jira</a> can connect with GitHub. But the right, magical balance of what works well for developers and what works well for project managers remains elusive. Full Agile information like user stories, story points, epics, backlog tracking, and burndowns is a significant layer on top of the developer-focused GitHub information of commit history, code review, and issue tracking. User testing tracking, documentation writing, and more involves the entire project team: coders, writers, and managers; and call for a tool in which everyone is equally comfortable working. Each product privileges either management needs or developer needs, and we have not yet found one that does not add pain-points for one group to remove them for another. We are fortunate at Omeka that the developer and project management groups are pretty fluid and conversant, and so we overcome those obstacles fairly easily. But we would still like a tool that removed the pain-points for everyone.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What-LibreCat'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>LibreCat/Catmandu (https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu) is an open source toolkit to manipulate (semi-)structured data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>LibreCat/Catmandu</h1>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We export data from databases such as library catalogs, institutional repositories, web services, relational and nosql databases and data dumps (such as MARC, XML, RDF, JSON, YAML). This data can be transformed using our <a href=\"https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki/Fix-language\" target=\"_blank\">Fix language</a> and stored again into catalogs, databases or data dumps. The process is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\">ETL</a> and exists already for many years in a billion dollar market, but until recently not many ETL tools targeted for library datasets were available and certainly not available as open source tools. The code is programmed in <a href=\"https://www.perl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Perl</a> and makes heavily use of existing <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org/modules/\" target=\"_blank\">CPAN modules</a> to process the various data formats. In our projects, we like to work with open source tools as <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\" target=\"_blank\">ElasticSearch</a>, <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Solr</a> as our backend data stores. For web development we are using the <a href=\"http://perldancer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Perl Dancer</a> and <a href=\"http://plackperl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Plack</a> which gives a very easy access to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSGI\" target=\"_blank\">PSGI</a> framework to create fast lightweight and web applications. In our coding community we make use of tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a>, <a href=\"https://coveralls.io/\" target=\"_blank\">CoverAlls</a> to keep our code in clean and tidy and help our core maintainer <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~nics/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Steenlant </a>to build our CPAN releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our developers are very much all running <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html\" target=\"_blank\">GNU/Linux</a> environments such as <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Debian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.centos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CentOS</a>. Then there are tools such as <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Puppet</a> to manage installations and automate a lot of the system administration tasks. For parallel processing we use GNU parallel to process large datasets. We rely very much on great existing open source applications such as <a href=\"http://www.fedora-commons.org/\">Fedora Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BlackLight</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.koha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Koha</a> to implement front-ends. To create statistics we are using R. To transform unstructured data <a href=\"http://pandoc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pandoc</a>. There are so many great open source tools available. As coders we don’t favor Perl, Python, Ruby or Java, rather we choose what is the best tool for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several big projects we are working on currently. We are creating a new version of our institutional repository LibreCat based on Catmandu to add support for research data and more <a href=\"http://www.maximus.com/cris\" target=\"_blank\">CRIS</a> functionality. The code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/LibreCat/LibreCat\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and will very soon go into production at <a href=\"http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/%28en%29/\" target=\"_blank\">Bielefeld University</a>. Then, we are working with <a href=\"https://www.iminds.be/en/contact/ghent\" target=\"_blank\">iMinds at Ghent University</a> to create tools for processing and publishing <a href=\"http://linkeddatafragments.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Data Fragments</a>. We think this is a great new technology to publish linked data on the Web. <a href=\"http://jakobvoss.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Jakob Voss</a> at <a href=\"http://www.gbv.de/\" target=\"_blank\">GBV</a> is creating a great suite of Perl modules to manipulate RDF. <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/JonasSmedegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Smedegaard</a> is pushing Catmandu into Debian. In the next release of Debian (Ubuntu etc) installing Catmandu will be as simple as a 'apt-get install catmandu' But, there is so much. If you look at GitHub there are dozens of <a href=\"http://librecat.org/distributions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Catmandu repositories</a> where our community creates new data processing tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be great if in the library world we could exchange more data manipulation recipes. Our intent with Fix language was to create data mappings that can be read by librarians and programmers. There are so many open source data manipulation tools available these days in Perl, Ruby, Python, Java, NodeJS (See also: <a href=\"http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#related-projects\" target=\"_blank\">http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#related-projects</a>). It would be great to have these projects work together and exchange best practises. There are already examples how this could be done, by for instance <a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/11013\" target=\"_blank\">combining LODRefine and Catmandu</a>. In our LibreCat institutional repository we have a strategic direction to use more <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">R programming</a> for the statistics of data processing. There is no need to reinvent the wheel of you have such a great open source tool available. In my dream I would open <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/\">RStudio</a>, write a little Fix script to manipulate a giant MARC/OAI-PMH/RDF dump and generate cool graphs using R. In the end, we do this all to get the data out, cleaned, there on the web freely accessible, with open licenses.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What-EEXCESS Project'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<h1>EEXCESS Project</h1>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://eexcess.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EEXCESS Project</a> is building a framework for recommendation of cultural and scientific resources, reaching users in their work context, e.g., when browsing the web or authoring texts. The system can integrate any type of cultural or scientific resources that can be queried with an API. It consists of backend components for federated recommendation from the different data providers, and different types of clients. We use a number of open source tools for the development. For the server components we use <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Tomcat</a> to host our services, <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/core/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Lucene</a> for indexing text resources, <a href=\"https://jenkins-ci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jenkins</a> for monitoring our services and <a href=\"http://www.soapui.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SOAP UI </a>for testing. The backend software is written in <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Java</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" target=\"_blank\">IDE</a> used for development is <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse</a>, using <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Maven</a> as build system. For semantic enrichment of text resources, <a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jena</a>, the <a href=\"http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Java WordNet Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/source-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Geonames Java client</a>. For visualization, <a href=\"http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/\" target=\"_blank\">jFreeChart</a> is used in Java applications, and <a href=\"http://www.jqplot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jqPlot</a> for web-based visualizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those mentioned above, we have used <a href=\"http://protege.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Protégé</a> for ontology development and <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Solr</a> as a search engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing? </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the applications and components developed in EEXCESS are open source, available on <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/eexcess\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> For the server side, this includes the recommenders for the different data providers and the federated recommender, which fuses their results. There is also a privacy proxy, which unlinks users and there queries and obfuscates queries to protect users’ privacy. For adding data providers, the <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/PartnerWizard\" target=\"_blank\">PartnerWizard</a>, a web-app developed using <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Maven archetypes</a> enables to add new providers quickly without the need for coding. There is also a range of client applications on the repository, implemented as plugins for widely used applications: Google Chrome, Wordpress, Google Docs and Moodle. The EEXCESS system is very modular, and a number of components may also be useful in other contexts, for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/DoSeR\" target=\"_blank\">DoSeR</a>, a component for disambiguation of semantic resources and a set of visualization widgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What we haven’t found up to now is a robust library for parsing incomplete and approximate time and place fields. And of course, we’d like to see data providers with searchable APIs, which could then feed data into the EEXCESS system.</p>"

        intro: 'Powerful new search features, filtering queries and retrieval of media files within Europeana''s metadata.'
        body: "<p>The REST API allows you not only to search on and retrieve metadata, but gives you also powerful features based on technical metadata. Technical metadata is metadata which is extracted from media files which reside in records, such as the width and height of an image. These features give you the possibility to search for and filter on Europeana records by media information, for instance to only search for records which have extra large images, high-quality audio files, or which images match a particular colour. These features were developed as part of the Content Re-use Framework within the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/\">Europeana Creative</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The media search features as described on this page are part of the existing <a href=\"/api/search/#request\">search API</a>, <a href=\"/api/data-fields/#technical-metadata-facets\">search facets</a> and the <a href=\"/api/record/#response\">record API response</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Background information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana extracts technical metadata from all media URL's within all the Europeana records (present within the edm:isShownBy and edm:hasView fields) in specific time intervals to verify whether all links still resolve and to extract technical metadata from these media files. This information is then made available for search and included in the record API. This information is updated on a continuous basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cardinality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Europeana metadata record can contain a reference to zero, one or more media files. When a search is made on a technical metadata property or facet (such as image size), a record is returned if one of the media files present in the record match the search query.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Search</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"/api/search/#request\">search API</a> allows searching on the following media parameters:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"width: 88px;\">Parameter</th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 93px;\">Datatype</th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 701px;\">Description</th>\r\n        </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 88px;\">media</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 93px;\">Boolean</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 701px;\">Filter by records where an URL to the full media file is present in the edm:isShownBy or edm:hasView metadata and is resolvable.</td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 88px;\">colourpalette</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 93px;\">String</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 701px;\">Filter by images where one of the colours of an image matches the provided colour code.

The facets also can be included in search queries to allow for very specific media searches such as querying on image size or audio duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following facets are available in the facets profile in search and can be searched on as well:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"width: 187px;\">Facet name</th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 87px;\">Datatype</th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 115px;\">Media type</th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 487px;\">Description</th>\r\n        </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 187px;\">MEDIA</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 87px;\">boolean</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 115px;\"></td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 487px;\">To indicate whether an URL to the full media file is present in the edm:isShownBy or edm:hasView metadata and is resolvable.</td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 187px;\">MIME_TYPE</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 87px;\">string</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 115px;\"></td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 487px;\">Mime-type of the file, e.g. image/jpeg</td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 187px;\">IMAGE_SIZE</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 87px;\">string</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 115px;\">Image</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 487px;\">Size in megapixels of an image, values: small (&lt; 0.5MP), medium (0.5-1MP), large (1-4MP) and extra_large (&gt; 4MP)</td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 187px;\">IMAGE_COLOUR</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 87px;\">boolean</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 115px;\">Image</td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 487px;\">Lists 'true' for colour images.

For this use-case we will construct API queries to retrieve openly licensed large and extra large images of paintings, display their thumbnails on a page and then display part of their technical metadata on a separate page for the image. This section will provide guidance on how to use the API in order to fulfil this use-case.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Retrieving large and extra large images</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We will start with the search query to retrieve the records. For this, we use the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>search.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;query=what:painting&amp;media=true&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:large&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large&amp;reusability=open</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nTo breakdown the search query:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>wskey=xxxx - API authentication, replace xxxx with your API key.</li>\r\n    <li>query=what:painting - Search for records where the subject is a painting.</li>\r\n    <li>media=true - Records where there is a link to a media file present in the metadata and where this links resolves to a working media file. Note that this parameter is not actually needed when you do a query for any of the media facets, which already imply the value of this parameter.</li>\r\n    <li>qf=IMAGE_SIZE:large - Records where an image is present of a large size (1-4MP).</li>\r\n    <li>qf=IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large - Records where an image is present of an extra large size (&gt;4 MP), note that the qf parameter can be included more than once and in this case equals to an 'OR' query.</li>\r\n    <li>reusability=open - Ensure that only openly licensed media is present in the search results.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<a href=\"/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=what:painting&amp;media=true&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:large&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large&amp;reusability=open\">Test on API Console</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Show search results as thumbnails</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have the search query, we need to use its output to render thumbnails of images on a page. First, note that we did not include any sample as for pagination, you need to apply this yourselves. For this you can use the 'rows' and 'start' parameters in the search API. To render thumbnails of the images in the search results, you need the following information from the search response:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>id - The identifier of the record.</li>\r\n    <li>title - The title of the record.</li>\r\n    <li>edmPreview - The URL to the thumbnail image of the main media file.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>With this information, you can build a page which shows the thumbnail (edmPreview), along with a title (title) and with a link to a separate page which at minimum should contain the identifier of the record (id). Next, we will help you create that separate page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Show the large image with its technical metadata</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If a user clicks on a thumbnail from the search results, next thing you want is to display a large (or extra large) images along with its technical metadata. For this, you need to retrieve the record information from the record API. An example query to the record API would be:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>/record/90402/BK_1978_399.json?wskey=xxxx</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the only parameter - aside from your API key, is the record identifier. In order to then display the (extra) large images and information from the technical metadata, you need to parse the record API response as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Use the URL from the \"edmIsShownBy\" field in the \"aggregations\" class as the URL of the image file. This field only appears once.</li>\r\n    <li>Iterate through the \"webResources\" in the same \"aggregations\" class until you find the WebResource element which URL (\"about\") corresponds with the \"edmIsShownBy\". In here, the technical metadata is present.</li>\r\n    <li>Then, render the technical metadata you want to display, for instance the \"ebucoreWidth\" and \"ebucoreHeight\" (width x height in pixels).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Other examples</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Find all records that match the query ‘Paris’ which are openly licensed and have large images:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>search.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;query=Paris&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:large</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=Paris&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:large\">Test on API Console</a>\r\n\r\n<p>Find all records that match the query Paris which have a thumbnail image, are of mime type image/jpeg and have an aspect ratio of 'landscape':</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>search.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;query=Paris&amp;thumbnail=true&amp;qf=MIME_TYPE:image%2Fjpeg&amp;qf=IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO:landscape</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=Paris&amp;thumbnail=true&amp;qf=MIME_TYPE:image%2Fjpeg&amp;qf=IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO:landscape\">Test on API Console</a>\r\n\r\n<p>Find all records where the subject is opera and where the results are sound files with a long duration:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>search.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;query=what:opera&amp;qf=SOUND_DURATION:long</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<a href=\"/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=what:opera&amp;qf=SOUND_DURATION:long\">Test on API Console</a>\r\n\r\n<p>Find all records where one of the images has a (dominant) red colour:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>search.json?wskey=xxxx&amp;query=*:*&amp;colourpalette=%23FF0000</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<a href=\"/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;colourpalette=%23FF0000\">Test on API Console</a>"

        intro: 'Discover the diverse reusable content about the First World War available on Europeana'
        body: "<p>In this guide we will point you to some of the re-usable material available through Europeana and the Europeana API focussed on the subject of the First World War. This has been written in support of the 1st Europeana Challenge, but of course is applicable to any project wishing to re-use this content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The First World War has been a particular focus for Europeana through our highly successful <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918 project</a>. This project has actively sought contributions from the public across Europe, providing a unique resource from all sides of the conflict. This now amounts to over 14,000 stories and 140,000 items. Items range from diaries and personal photographs, to images of objects related to the conflict. Most material is available under an open license. The project has also been a focal point for sourcing rich and diverse collections from museums, libraries and archives across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/ww1-hermann-gebauer-298.png\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/298\">Bilder von meinem Vater Hermann Gebauer aus dem 1. Weltkrieg</a>. Provided by Siegfried Gebauer CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few examples to get things started:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana 1914-1918 website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This site is the focal point for all WW1 related content. It allows you to explore both institutional and user submitted content. The user submitted content has primarily been sourced via collection days that have run across Europe, where people have contributed photographs, artefacts and stories, typically relating to their family history. There are also video interviews available.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>All <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana1914-1918 Collections</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?qf%5Bindex%5D=c\" target=\"_blank\">User submitted content</a></li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Europeana Labs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Europeana Labs we feature notable open datasets. For each there is a link to browse the collection and for developers our API console shows how to query the API to extract that content.

        title: 'Europeana Awards at Loomehakk, Estonia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'We teamed up with Digix and Tallinn University to select and fund up to three projects using cultural heritage material from Europeana in a creative app or service'
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1171478069548695/\">Loomehäkk</a> took place in Tallinn, Estonia, the weekend of 29-31 January 2016. This 48 hour hackathon posed the question \"What happens when you mix creative industries with IT?\" and brought together over 120 technologists, designers, and media specialists from across Estonia's vibrant creative communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was run by <a href=\"http://digix.eu/\">Digix</a>, the Digital Creative Incubator, and Tallinn University , who also provided the great venue in the <a href=\"http://www.tlu.ee/bfm\">Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School</a>. Europeana partnered with the event to help and encourage participants to use Europe's rich cultural heritage in their apps and services, with the added incentive of the chance to share a €25,000 prize fund to help them turn their idea into reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting 3pm on Friday, participants pitched their ideas, followed by a frenzied half hour forming teams. Once again, designers and developers were much in demand! Teams were then allocated rooms and immediately set to work, knowing that in 48 hours they would have to pitch their product to the gathered jury. For the Europeana prize they would also have to address some key points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Must re-use Europeana openly licensed content</li>\r\n    <li>Demonstrate clear social and/or economic impact</li>\r\n    <li>Have a viable business model</li>\r\n    <li>Have a strong team behind them</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>During the 48 hours there were further sessions with mentors from fields such as business development, app promotion, and technology, plus coaching for the all important pitches. For those teams planning to use Europeana content, I spent time with them at first refining the ideas and suggesting suitable content, then as the first day went on, increasingly giving direct support accessing the content both via the Europeana Collections site (for hand-picked, manual access) and for automated access through the Europeana API. On the Sunday morning, as the hours counted down, time was spent focussing each team on delivering a good pitch and exploring how they would address the key questions for the prize fund. It was clear that some found this easier than others, but as we have seen before it is exactly these issues which will give teams the chance to create a product that has the highest impact and stands a chance of being sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/loomehakk-participants.jpg\"><br>\r\nParticipants at Loomehäkk, January 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pitches were some of the best I have seen at a hackathon, with all teams sticking to time, and having real focus in their approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>And the awards go to ...</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After careful consideration, and with much fanfare (livestreamed on Estonian TV!), I announced the three Europeana winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Postcarding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Postcarding is an app focussed on discovering the history, people and places on old postcards through transcription and tagging. It was developed by Vahur Puik, the man behind successful geotagging app <a href=\"http://ajapaik.ee/\">Ajapaik (Timepatch)</a> and more recent tagging app <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pics.sift.app\">SiftPics</a>. Whilst there are other tools out there, it is clear that Vahur has a strong record developing products with cultural heritage material and a sound understanding of the content. The opportunity identified was to harmonise these products into a toolset that could be used by cultural heritage institutes for crowdsourcing and enriching their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vahur Puik says \"Postcards are usually collected, consulted and reused for their picture side but where collections have the reverse sides nicely scanned we discovered that these may have small authentic stories, people’s messages to each other there. And also a lot of information can be detected from the stamps, postmarks. But these messages, names, dates, and places exist only as picture, not as searchable text or data. During Loomehäkk we developed Postcarding - <a href=\"http://postkaart.ajapaik.ee/\">postkaart.ajapaik.ee</a> - to 'address' this problem, and also to enhance our existing apps\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/loomehakk-postcarding.jpg\"><br>\r\nVahur Puik pitching the Postcarding app</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>VR Quiz</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The VR Quiz team brought together an impressive range of technologists and cultural heritage experts with the aim of creating a virtual reality quiz game that could be experienced on the Oculus Rift platform within museums and galleries. They showed a real understanding of the content and the desire to use it to create an authentic and engaging experience. This set them apart from other VR experiences - the prototype developed in just two days included a WW1 environment which included 3D objects sourced through Europeana, but also a back-end powered by the Europeana API where those creating the quiz content could search for items and easily select them. Of course there are questions as to how this can be translated into a viable product, but with some initial funding this is exactly the question that can be explored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rain Vagel says \"Our app is a Virtual Reality quiz game in which the player will be put into an immersive environment with periodic buildings, objects and music. In the future we want to implement multiple rooms and a kind of treasure hunt element to it. The game also includes a simple to use quiz builder in which people can search Europeana for pictures with the same amount of ease that one would use Google. The event was very interesting, but also quite difficult for us working to short deadlines with VR technology. Before you even realised, it was 6 o’clock in the morning and you weren’t even tired. We had an excellent and highly motivated team who worked throughout the night to make this happen.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGpFnu4tC-k?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Language of History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Language of History team proposed a tool where people could learn words in other languages through historic pictures. From the first pitch I was sure there were the seeds of an exciting idea, something that could really work. The small team were keen to listen to ideas (for example around crowdsourcing) and showed great enthusiasm, developing an effective demonstration by the time of the pitches on Sunday afternoon. The idea of gathering multilingual tags on the back of creating an effecting learning tool is something that will be fascinating to pursue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria Medina says \"History of Language was born from the necessity of engaging with the historical treasures of the European nations through language learning. Loomehakk in Tallinn, Estonia, was the perfect opportunity to explore how to achieve this ideal by designing and implementing an online prototype - <a href=\"http://tuurkunn.esy.es/europeana/\" target=\"_blank\">tuurkunn.esy.es/europeana/</a> \"</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we will talk with each team and work out what support they need - whether that's business model development, market research, or perhaps technical development - and decide exactly how we will allocate the prize fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look forward to working with all the winners to help them grow their ideas.</p>"

        intro: 'Find rich, high quality reusable content for your art or design project'
        body: "<p>Europe’s galleries, museums, libraries and archives are rich in beautiful visual materials suitable for all kinds of art and design related projects. Increasingly these are being made available in high resolution and with open licenses, and new features in the Europeana Collections website and Europeana API allow users to find high quality materials perfect for their creative needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we will explain the different ways that you can explore, uncover and access these materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Collections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently relaunched Europeana Collections website is a searchable, visual interface to the complete collection of nearly 50 million records. Browsing through individual items you can, where available, manually download original media files. A good place to start is the Europeana <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Art History Collection</a> - a broad selection of over 1.2 million art history related items, together with thematic exhibitions and curated collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/art-history-collection.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some further Collections links and tips to help you:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the left hand side of any <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?q=\">search results page</a> you will see extra filters that allow you to refine your search</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>First you will want to select an appropriate license - for most creative projects it's best to choose the option \"<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=\">Can I use it?

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'Find rich, high quality reusable content on the theme of Europe''s Music Heritage'
        body: "<p>Europe is steeped with musical heritage and this diversity is well reflected on Europeana. Increasingly items are being made available with open licenses and direct access to media files, and new features in the Europeana Collections website and Europeana API allow users to quickly find high quality content for their projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we will explain the different ways that you can explore, uncover and access these materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Collections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently relaunched Europeana Collections website is a searchable, visual interface to the complete collection of nearly 50 million records. Browsing through individual items you can, where available, manually download original media files. A good place to start is the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/music\">Europeana Music Collection</a> which provides access to over 270,000 items, including images, text, video and of course sounds, representing nearly every European country (plus a few more from further afield). You'll also find thematic exhibitions and curated collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/music\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/datasets/music-collection.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some further Collections links and tips to help you:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the left hand side of any <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?q=\">search results page</a> you will see extra filters that allow you to refine your search</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>First you will want to select an appropriate license - for most creative projects it's best to choose the option \"<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=\">Can I use it? Yes - with attribution</a>\" which will only contain re-usable content that can be used commercially and be modified.</li>\r\n    <li>Then you may want to choose a content type, such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=SOUND&amp;q=\">just sounds</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>At this point more content-specific options appear, such as filtering by sound quality or duration. For example the Music Collection contains <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music?f%5BSOUND_DURATION%5D%5B%5D=medium&amp;f%5BSOUND_DURATION%5D%5B%5D=long&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=SOUND&amp;q=\">over 1,200 items with direct links to audio files with a duration of 3 minutes or more</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Of course you can also combine these with standard text searches, such as looking for a specific composer (such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music?q=who%3ARichard+Strauss+\">Richard Strauss</a>), or from a particular provider (such as the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Irish+Traditional+Music+Archive%22\">Irish Traditional Music Archive</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Europeana Labs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On Europeana Labs we have a showcase of apps and creations that have been made with Europeana content. There's a special <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps?category=audiovisual\">audiovisual category</a> that contains some inspirational creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana API</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana API provides direct access for developers to the complete data available through Europeana. This allows the creation of powerful, content rich apps and services. Indeed our own website runs on the API, and all the search methods mentioned above and in use on the Collections website are available as API paramaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example queries</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Openly licensed content - <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;reusability=open&amp;profile=rich\">&amp;reusability=open</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Limit to items with HD audio files - <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=SOUND_HQ:true&amp;profile=rich\">&amp;qf=SOUND_HQ:true</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>People searches e.g. artists - <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=who:Richard+Strauss&amp;profile=rich\">&amp;qf=who:Richard+Strauss</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Limit searches to a specific provider or collection (e.g. British Library) - <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200251_Ag_EU_TEL_a1200a_British_Library*&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">&amp;qf=europeana_collectionName%3A9200251_Ag_EU_TEL_a1200a_British_Library*</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>to replicate the wider subject-based filter used for the Music Collection see the <a href=\"/data/music-collections\">Music dataset page</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Read more about the API in our extensive <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">API documentation</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Learn how to use the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/new-media-search-methods-in-the-europeana-api\">new media metadata methods</a> to restrict searches to items with directly available media files such as images and audio; also to search by quality, colour, and a whole lot more!</li>\r\n    <li>See how to ensure that you <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/can-i-use-it\">use content that is correctly licensed for your product</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Data is also available via a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-introduction\">SPARQL endpoint</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/oai-pmh-introduction\">OAI-PMH</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Need help?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Full details for the entry criteria to the 1st Europeana Challenge can be found on the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/europeana-challenges\">Challenge page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions or are seeking particular content, please email <a href=\"http://mailto:api@europeana.eu/\">api@europeana.eu</a></p>"

        intro: 'Find high quality, re-usable photographs from across Europe, and beyond'
        body: "<p>Europe’s galleries, museums, libraries and archives contain a wealth of photographic materials from many genre. This includes images from the very earliest days of photography in the 1840s, high quality art photography from famous photographers, early topographic photographs depicting locations around the world, plus of course record photographs depicting items in the collections themselves. Increasingly these are being made available in high resolution and with open licenses, and new features in the Europeana Collections website and Europeana API allow users to find high quality materials perfect for a diverse range of creative needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this diversity can come complexity, so in this guide we will explain the different ways that you can explore, uncover and access these materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/datasets/91672_Malmo.jpg\">Europeana Collections</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently relaunched Europeana Collections website is a searchable, visual interface to the complete collection of nearly 50 million records. Browsing through individual items you can, where available, manually download original media files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limiting results to just photographs can be a challenge, but one of the easiest ways to filter results is by descriptive facets. Try terms like what:\"Photograph\" and what:\"Foto\". And combine these to find as many as possible, such as this example query - <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22++OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22\">what:\"Photography\" OR what:\"photo\"OR what:\"foto\" OR what:\"photographie\" OR what:\"Photograph\" OR what:\"http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/13123\"</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach can owrk particularly well within the items from one provider with a diverse collection. For example for the Rijksmuseum, known more for its paintings, using <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BIMAGE_SIZE%5D%5B%5D=extra_large&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Rijksmuseum&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3Aphotograph\">what:photograph</a> gives over 9,500 images, all Public Domain and available for direct download in high resolution.  Becasue of their high quality metadata, you can also further filter this set by type, for example to find steroviews using <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Rijksmuseum&amp;f%5BIMAGE_ASPECTRATIO%5D%5B%5D=Landscape&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22stereoscopic+photographs%22\">what:\"stereoscopic photographs\"</a> (ca 900 results). Note that this approach may not work for all providers, so it is worth experimenting with terms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also several notable Europeana projects and providers that have photographic themed collections</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=EuropeanaPhotography&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">Europeana Photography</a> - contains a high quality collection of approximately 125,000 resuable (if mainly small) images</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Daguerreobase&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">Daguerreobase</a> - a collection of over 12,000 reusable thumbnail images (though watermarked), contanng about 2,600 which have links to low resolution versions without watermarks. Higher resolution versions may be available indirectly via the providers' websites.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Here are some Collections links and tips to help you</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When running searches, lots of options are available to further filter content. On the left hand side of any <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22++OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22\">search results page</a> you will see extra filters that allow you to refine your search:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>First you will want to select an appropriate license - for most creative projects it's best to choose the option \"<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=\">Can I use it? Yes - with attribution</a>\" which will only contain re-usable content that can be used commercially and be modified. But if you have a non-commercial project then you can include \"<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22++OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22\">Can I use it? Yes - with restrictions</a>\" but be sure to check that individual restrictions such as if you are planning to create derivative images, or if you need to 'Share Alike'.</li>\r\n    <li>You may have noticed that these links also pre-select <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=\">just images</a>, as opposed to text, audio and video or even 3D, but you may find further interesting resources if you <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22++OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22\">open up the search to all content types</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>When you select one specific type, content-specific options appear such as filtering by image resolution. Using the example above, we can find <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BIMAGE_SIZE%5D%5B%5D=extra_large&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22++OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22\">over 50,000 items relating to photography with directly accessible images greater than 4 megapixels</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Other options are available, such as searching by colour. This is based on the W3C palette, and you can <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/browse/colours\">see a full list of indexed colours</a>. Note that there is also an option to filter colour vs black and white, but this is a technical quality rather than the appearance of the photograph, so can return false positives as most photographic images are (correctly) scanned in full colour even when they may be described popularly as ‘black and white’.</li>\r\n    <li>Of course you can also combine these with standard text searches, such as looking for <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22+OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22&amp;qf%5B%5D=what%3Aportrait&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">portraits</a> or photographs related to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=what%3A%22Photography%22+OR+what%3A%22photo%22OR+what%3A%22foto%22+OR+what%3A%22photographie%22+OR+what%3A%22Photograph%22+OR+what%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eionet.europa.eu%2Fgemet%2Fconcept%2F13123%22&amp;qf%5B%5D=what%3Atransport&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">transport</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Europeana Labs</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On Europeana Labs we feature some of the best open datasets in Europeana.

Contributed by Arietta Ruß as part of the Europeana 1914-18 project. CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many photographic related applications require location-based material, it’s worth giving some extra advice on how to find these.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Within the Europeana API there is the ability to search for geotagged materials using a bounding box. You can append a parameter such as<br>\r\n    &amp;qf=pl_wgs84_pos_lat:[50.8628526691932+TO+50.89686185152743]+AND+pl_wgs84_pos_long:[4.644899368286132+TO+4.756135940551758]<br>\r\n    This has been used on the PostcodePast site that has a small script to generate a geoJson feed for display using LeafletJS - e.g. see <a href=\"http://postcodepast.com/data/europeana.php?bbox=4.644899368286132,50.8628526691932,4.756135940551758,50.89686185152743\">http://postcodepast.com/data/europeana.php?bbox=4.644899368286132,50.8628526691932,4.756135940551758,50.89686185152743</a> (feel free to use this for testing, but for production purposes you can find the code under an open license on GitHub)</li>\r\n    <li>The presence of geotagged material can be limited if providers have not given geotags with their metadata. There are a few possible ways to overcome this, for example by searching for a location name. You can simply type the name as a search term e.g. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=leuven&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">q=Leuven</a> or if that returns poor results try the more specific <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;page=4&amp;q=what%3ALeuven\">&amp;qf=what:Leuven OR Louvain OR Löwen</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>An example of this approach has been implemented on PostcodePast which uses the Wikipedia API to find geotagged points of interest and then searches these names within Europeana (and Flickr &amp; DPLA) - see e.g. <a href=\"http://postcodepast.com/#lat=50.8798438&amp;lng=4.700517600000012&amp;zoom=14\">http://postcodepast.com/#lat=50.8798438&amp;lng=4.700517600000012&amp;zoom=14</a>.

        body: "<p>Whilst many people write apps and services based on realtime access to the API, a frequent request is to get bulk downloads of specific subsets of items, including both their metadata and their associated media files.

The link to the Europeana Collections site is</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f[IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO][]=Landscape&amp;f[IMAGE_COLOUR][]=true&amp;f[IMAGE_SIZE][]=extra_large&amp;f[PROVIDER][]=Rijksmuseum&amp;f[REUSABILITY][]=open&amp;f[TYPE][]=IMAGE&amp;page=1&amp;q=photograph&amp;qf[]=gaudin</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>which translates as the API call</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxx&amp;query=photograph&amp;qf=gaudin&amp;qf=IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO%3ALandscape&amp;qf=IMAGE_COLOUR%3Atrue&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Aextra_large&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3ARijksmuseum&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll note that this has already been filtered to openly resusable items with 'extra large' (&gt;4megapixel), directly available image files (58 at the time of writing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing we want to do is maximise the number of records using &amp;rows=100 and set &amp;profile=rich which will ensure that we get the link to the media file in the response. Finally, as we don't always know the full number of records but we want to download everything, we'll choose &amp;cursor=* which will give us cursor based pagination - regular pagination would restrict us to 1,000 results (see the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search#pagination\">pagination documentation</a> for details). So our full query becomes:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxx&amp;query=photograph&amp;qf=gaudin&amp;qf=IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO%3ALandscape&amp;qf=IMAGE_COLOUR%3Atrue&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Aextra_large&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3ARijksmuseum&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;start=1&amp;rows=100&amp;profile=rich&amp;cursor=*</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we have a base for our query, we can start coding. The logic is to set some general variables, make an API call, loop through the records in the response, extracting the chosen metadata and saving it to a csv file whilst also fetching and saving the images to a local directory. We then repeat the calls using the nextCursor value taken from the previous response, until all the results have been found (or the manual limit reached, if set).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course you can do this in your language of choice, but a simple implementation in PHP is given below, and a slightly enhanced version which also zips up the resulting files <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesinealing/europeana-snippets/blob/master/getimages.php\">can be found on GitHub</a> under an open license.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lt;?php<br>\r\nheader('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');</p>\r\n\r\n<p>/*<br>\r\n* An example of a simple script to create a csv of basic metadata<br>\r\n* and a zip file of downloaded images from a cursor paginated search.json API call.<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n* Whilst working code, this is intended to simply demonstrate a typical appraoch<br>\r\n* and does not include user input, error checking, image sizing etc<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n* Note depending on the query this can result in a very large number of very large<br>\r\n* files being stored on the server it's runing on!<br>\r\n*/</p>\r\n// create a directory to store results in, based on timestamp<br>\r\n$directory = 'downloads/'.time().'/';<br>\r\nmkdir($directory, 0777, true);\r\n<p>// set some starting variables<br>\r\n$apikey='api2demo';<br>\r\n$fetchedrecords=0; // how many records have been fetched so far<br>\r\n$rows=18; // the number of rows from each API response - max 100<br>\r\n$records=''; // we'll set this from the api response<br>\r\n$limit= 100; // change this to limit results rather than get full dataset<br>\r\n$cursor='*'; // starting cursor for pagination of full dataset - see http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search#pagination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// if we're just starting OR we've not fetched all records or reched the manually set limit AND we've got a cursor value for the next page<br>\r\nwhile ($records=='' OR ($records!=0 &amp;&amp; $fetchedrecords&lt;=$records &amp;&amp; $fetchedrecords&lt;=$limit) &amp;&amp; $cursor!='') {<br>\r\n// set and fecth the API response<br>\r\n$apicall='http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey='.$apikey.'&amp;query=photograph&amp;qf=gaudin&amp;qf=IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO%3ALandscape&amp;qf=IMAGE_COLOUR%3Atrue&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Aextra_large&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3ARijksmuseum&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;cursor='.$cursor.'&amp;rows='.$rows.'&amp;profile=rich';</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$json = file_get_contents($apicall);<br>\r\n$response = json_decode($json);<br>\r\n//print_r($response);<br>\r\n// check there are records then loop through each one, extracting metadata<br>\r\n$records = (isset($response-&gt;totalResults) ? $response-&gt;totalResults : 0);<br>\r\necho $apicall.'&lt;br&gt;$totalResults: '.$response-&gt;totalResults.'&lt;br&gt;';<br>\r\n$fetchedrecords = $fetchedrecords + $rows;<br>\r\n$htmldata = '&lt;hr&gt;Page '.$fetchedrecords/$rows.'&lt;br&gt;';<br>\r\n// create the html to display results/progress to the user<br>\r\n$htmldata .='Fetching records: '.($fetchedrecords-$rows+1).' to '.$fetchedrecords.' of '.$records.'&lt;br&gt;';<br>\r\nforeach ($response-&gt;items as $record) {<br>\r\n$europeanaID=$record-&gt;id;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// get the image file and save it<br>\r\n$imageURL=$record-&gt;edmIsShownBy[0];<br>\r\n$filename=str_replace(\"/\",\"_\",$europeanaID).'.jpg';<br>\r\n// $filename=basename($imageURL); // use this *only* if the dataset has unique filenames<br>\r\n$output = $directory.'/'.$filename;<br>\r\nfile_put_contents($output, file_get_contents($imageURL));</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// add the record to the csv file<br>\r\n$csvdata = array($europeanaID,$imageURL,$filename);<br>\r\nif (file_exists($directory.'data.csv') &amp;&amp; !is_writeable($directory.'data.csv')){<br>\r\necho 'csv file write failed';<br>\r\nreturn false;<br>\r\n}<br>\r\nif ($datafile = fopen($directory.'data.csv', 'a')){<br>\r\nfputcsv($datafile, $csvdata);<br>\r\nfclose($datafile);<br>\r\n} else {<br>\r\necho 'Failed to write metadata csv file';<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n// put in a small time delay to be nice to providers' servers<br>\r\nsleep(1);<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n// output the html to screen so user can see what's gong on!<br>\r\necho $htmldata; echo '&lt;hr&gt;';<br>\r\n// get the cursor value from the response in order to fetch the next page of results<br>\r\n$cursor = urlencode($response-&gt;nextCursor);<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n?&gt;</p>\r\n</blockquote>"

        title: 'Europeana Labs Challenge 2016: Winners announced!'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In February, we launched the first in a series of online challenges to increase the innovative re-use of the digital cultural heritage available via Europeana. For this competition, we invited creative thinkers to submit their projects using cultural content on the themes of First World War, Art &amp; Design and Europe's Music Heritage and had an allocated prize fund of 25 000 EUR to support the further development of the best ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge closed with more than 50 applications, some of which came from outside Europe. We evaluated each of them <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/europeana-challenges\">against the competition criteria</a> and shortlisted 7 projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, we conducted personal interviews with each of candidates to discuss, in greater detail, their product concept and business model, as well as cost estimates and delivery timeframe. Faced with a range of strong ideas with enthusiastic teams behind them, we decided to extend the prize fund to 35 000 EUR and support the further development of the three projects below (the winners are presented in alphabetical order):</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Art Stories (Prize of 10 000 EUR)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovative Italian start-up <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/\">Art Stories</a> develops educational apps for kids (aged 5-10 years) using cultural heritage material. So far, they have launched 5 applications with more than 40, 000 downloads worldwide and have won significant innovation awards in Italy such as TIM WCAP and Innovazione Culturale by Fondazione Cariplo.<br><br>\r\nArt Stories will develop an educational app (iOS and Android) that will introduce primary school children to European art using selected artworks from Europeana Collections, alongside animations, gamification, audio storytelling and various learning assignments (for example, a composition game or a drawing task).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘artwork story’ and the associated assignments can also be downloaded, printed and used in museums. The app (both the iOS and the Android version) are expected to be available in Apple and Google Play stores in early July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CineMacina (Prize of 10 000 EUR)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CineMacina was submitted by the <a href=\"http://www.iaaa.n\">Institute for Artificial Art Amsterdam</a> (IAAA), an independent organisation that has applied its vision of generative art and design to a wide range of artistic domains - from mechanical guitar installations to computer controlled facial expressions and random radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project will be a collaboration between Luuk Bouwman, an experienced documentary maker, and Jos de Bruin, an experienced software developer and designer of algorithmic, generative art and design applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IAAA will develop an online service based on artificial intelligence that will allow automatic remixing and cinematic visualisation of First World War archival material. The system will act as automated filmmaker and deliver, in seconds, a movie based the keywords given by the user and its AI algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service will offer history enthusiasts and students an immersive experience and trigger further exploration of Europeana Collections by giving access to the reference sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IAAA team will deliver the online service prototype and two WW1 essay documentaries by early July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>StoryPix (Prize of 15 000 EUR)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>StoryPix is the brainchild of Paul Ruseler, an independent professional specialising in audio- and video storytelling. For his Europeana Challenge project, Paul will work together with <a href=\"http://www.noterik.nl\">Noterik</a>, a Dutch company with over 10 years experience in video applications development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team will develop a web-based storytelling service for billboards. The displays will show an artwork from Europeana Collections with an odd question or stimulating remark. By connecting to the StoryPix website (no download required), the user can further interact with the artwork (listen to its story, play with the image, add it to their online collection, share it and potentially print on demand). The service will allow to create thematic storytelling routes in a specific area or a whole city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team will deliver the system prototype and one Europeana inspired storytelling installation by early July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish the winning projects lots of luck as they get stuck into bringing their ideas to life, and look forward to the exciting results. Keep an eye on Europeana Labs for the updates in early summer!</p>"

        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s open up our vaults and go on a treasure hunt! Platoniq, with the Europeana Fashion Association and Europeana, is offering a co-creation workshop on 20 April at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the framework of the Europeana DSI project, participants from cultural institutions will collectively search for uses and re-uses of digital heritage in fashion and cultural heritage. Together, we’ll create prototypes during the workshop, focusing on crowdsourcing as a way to strengthen and develop ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platoniq wants to see how content holders view, use or imagine using their content, to help us refine our ‘Co-creation made Agile’ methodology (developed by Platoniq as part of the Europeana Creative project) for future re-use workshops. We want to improve access for the re-use of digital heritage, and to satisfy the needs of content holders and the creative re-use community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants have been invited to choose 12 treasures from their collections for re-use. We'll share these collections (using Pinterest boards) and contextualize the results, looking at publishing and licensing issues. <a href=\"https://es.pinterest.com/mauriob/europeana-fashion/\">See Platoniq’s example.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help with the selection process, we have created a <a href=\"http://public.platoniq.net/YOUCOOP/EUROPEANA/Relevance_guidelines.pdf\">graphical guide on the relevance criteria</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-04/relevance-guidelines-steps.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 848px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This guide offers selection criteria: Visual Impact, Data Accuracy, “Is it shareable?”, and Ranking. Each category has a “yes/no” field; the more “yes” answers, the greater the relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Visual Impact</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Each photo must tell a story. Does it communicate something? Does it have historical relevance? Does it convey a quality of rarity? Can it engage people? Is the subject clear, direct? Is it 'striking'? We’ll also evaluate things like resolution, colour quality, and other technical criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Data Accuracy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Verifying attribution data accuracy is crucial. Names must be detailed; authors, people or places must be identified. Items need a date and short description.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Is it shareable?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Can the image be shared? To what extent? For licensing compliance, we must evaluate these categories: Open licence (or Public Domain), Creative Commons (with an increasing order of restrictions), and Copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/examples/\">Here's a thorough explanation</a> of examples that use different forms of Creative Commons licenses if you’d like to learn more.<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/examples/\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and the DPLA (with<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\"> Creative Commons</a>,<a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/\"> Kennisland</a> and other key stakeholders from Europeana’s Network) have recently <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/rightsstatements-org-launches-at-dpla-fest-in-washington-dc\">launched Rightsstatements.org</a>. This site provides <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en\">11 standardized rights statements</a> created for cultural heritage institutions, making it easier to see if and how cultural objects can be re-used</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Ranking</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll review the voting as we select images, and see if higher ranking on “shared emotions” reveals more attractive images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranking scale:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 12+ ......VERY RELEVANT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 8 - 11 ...RELEVANT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 4 - 7 .....NOT VERY RELEVANT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 1 - 3 .....IRRELEVANT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results will guide participants with challenges like scenario planning, collective decision-making, defining personas, their relation to cultural objects, and group design/visual definition of ideas. Each participant’s collection will be compared with the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. The higher the quality of information, the more benefit they’ll create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-04/cardmock-up-fashion.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platoniq has done its homework! With the Europeana Fashion association, we’ve created a beautiful set of printed cards (online soon). If you want to be part of this premiere (and get this set of pictures), you’ll have to come to Rijkmuseum on 20 April. Each participant will receive one of these collector’s items!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So...are you a designer? A developer, maybe? An artist, cultural manager, creative, techie or marketing expert? Take a day to let your imagination flow, and join us at the Europeana Fashion workshop!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can’t join us, you can still participate: create your “12 treasures” Pinterest board, and share it with the @Platoniq Pinterest account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Become the next Morpheus Cup Champion! Submit your project using Europeana Collections'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>We’re excited to announce that, for this year’s edition of the <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/\">Morpheus Cup</a>, Europeana has introduced a new category for the competition: ‘Smart Culture’. We’d like students from universities across Europe to submit innovative projects devoted to the re-use of digital culture content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To have a chance of being our very first Morpheus Cup ‘Smart Culture’ winner, all you need to do is develop a creative proposal making use of the cultural objects you find in Europeana Collections and <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/registering-a-team/\">submit it before 29 April</a>. Registration is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/22-04-2016-morpheus-cup-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants during the <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/medias-downloads/\">Morpheus Cup 2015</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Morpheus Cup</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what’s the Morpheus Cup? The competition, dedicated to European universities and graduate schools, aims to bring together students for an innovation lab focused on projects and challenges relating to the digital world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the event, happening on 10 May at the European Convention Center Luxembourg (ECCL) a winning project with a strong entrepreneurial idea, has the chance to present to a panel of industry experts and potential investors. It’s a great opportunity for undergraduates to meet potential employers, and network with a community of entrepreneurs, start-ups and investors. And on top of that, a total of 50,000 EUR in prizes will be awarded to the winners!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana and “Smart Culture”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition has <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/project/\">19 different categories</a>, each with different sector themes, and an overall top award for which only the category champions will compete. The contestants must develop projects that aim to solve current issues linked to the industries of their choice. In the case of the Smart Culture category specifically, Europeana is on the look-out for projects that showcase innovative re-use of Europeana Collections, helping to strengthen the digital cultural heritage sector with imaginative and entrepreneurial solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re looking for a champion in this category with the most groundbreaking re-use of the cultural content Europeana Collections opens up access to. The category winner will then become a finalist for the Morpheus Cup 2016! Do you think you have an original pitch you can impress us with? If you’re a university student, then we’d love to hear from you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/22-04-2016-morpheus-cup-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another official photo of the <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/medias-downloads/\">Morpheus Cup 2015.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I submit a proposal?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to take part of the “Smart Culture” challenge, your proposal must follow certain requirements. Firstly, you should be aware of what we are looking for. Your idea must use openly licensed content from Europeana, be technically feasible, and have a clearly defined target customer group (s) and value proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, be sure to demonstrate clear social and/or economic impact with your idea by meeting at least one of these criteria:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Offer novel ways of experiencing and/or interacting with digital culture;</li>\r\n    <li>Support life-long learning, for instance, have a strong educational element;</li>\r\n    <li>And allow commercial re-use of cultural data.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty of cultural items on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana Collections</a> to take inspiration from. We have thematic collections on music, art history and about the First World War, for instance. Explore Europeana Collections by typing keywords and using search filters to find books, newspapers, artworks, maps, drawings, radio broadcasts and curated exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a look at our openly licensed datasets, access <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>. Furthermore, you can use Europeana Labs to find our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">APIs</a> to easily search and retrieve Europeana data. Go to the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/europeanaapi\">API Google group</a> to know more and to provide us with your feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We accept projects at various stages of maturity (concept, prototype, early stage product), of various types (apps, games, online services, artistic and product designs) and that can be used in various sectors. A few examples of the kinds of things that you could build, according to the Morpheus Cup, include an idea dedicated to the visually impaired or to life-long learning (i.e. social solutions); or proposals for sector-specific applications (design, fashion, tourism, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, your application needs to be formatted in specific standards. You must register a short project presentation that explains how you followed the category requirements. Make sure it contains your project name, lead name and email address as well. The submission should present up to five supporting visuals (screenshots, images, videos, URLs) and can be displayed in one of these formats:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Up to a ten slides presentation;</li>\r\n    <li>A PDF file of maximum pages;</li>\r\n    <li>And a video (as a link, no longer than 3 minutes).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>If you are an undergraduate with an interesting or inspirational idea involving Europeana Collections items, then get creating and <a href=\"http://www.morpheuscup.com/registering-a-team/\">register before 29 April!</a></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Co-creation Marathon at Rijksmuseum! 8 hours, 6 prototypes!'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>This blog post was contributed by Olivier Schulbaum from <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/page/platoniq\">Platoniq</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 20 April, Platoniq held a co-creation workshop at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, in collaboration with the Europeana Fashion Association and Europeana. This workshop had a special focus on fashion and on interesting ways to use and re-use digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a welcome greeting from Lizzy Jongma of the Rijksmuseum, Platoniq gave a short presentation explaining the rules of working in open space, and introduced the road map for the upcoming day’s intense activities. Plans for the day included collaboratively designing digital projects and software applications by following the principles of the <a href=\"https://issuu.com/platoniq/docs/platoniq_co-creation_eng\">Co-creation made Agile </a>methodology: starting with idea generation; creating the initial wireframes; and then development planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/platoniq-workshop-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participants during the Europeana Fashion Co-creation Workshop at the Rijksmuseum.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Which Fashion animal are you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We got the ball rolling with some lovely antique animal images from Europeana used as symbols for different user roles – a nice introduction to digital heritage reuse. These were prepared as stickers and badges for participants to wear, to help define groups and session roles. The roles and their animal symbols were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Content holders / Curators: Kangaroo</li>\r\n    <li>Designers / Creatives: Butterfly</li>\r\n    <li>Developers / Coders: Monkey</li>\r\n    <li>Managers / Promoters: Owl</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We had a majority of kangaroos, but they were joined by some butterflies - independent international designers - and a couple of owls, namely people from Benetton, now a supporting member of the Europeana Fashion Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once profiles were chosen, we made groups for the inspiration session, where participants imagine and briefly show something they consider to be good practices (apps, sites, online exhibition, services, etc.) in the digital fashion or digital cultural heritage sector. This helps establish a common criteria, leading to group decision and selection dynamics in the collective prototyping of new ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/platoniq-workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One of the working groups of the co-creation workshop.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From inspiration we move on to content...new ideas need content! And you’d better start with a reality check: is there content ready to be reused in Europeana, and in participants’ collections?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one side, with Europeana Fashion we curated a selection of 12 treasures for each of the featured categories: Costumes, Jewelry, Surface Decorations, Shoes, and had it printed. On the other, we asked participants to curate their own boards in advance, revealing 12 treasures of their own collection to be reused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the highlight of the<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/treasure-hunt-find-12-re-usable-buried-treasures-in-your-fashion-collection\"> Treasure Hunt</a> exercise was a <a href=\"https://es.pinterest.com/eurfashion/twelve-treasures-the-israel-museum-jerusalem/\">selection from the Israel Museum, Jerusalem</a>. Curated by Allison Kupietzky, it features elegant and ornate bridal dresses and accessories of diverse origins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we’ve got good scenarios and good content, it’s time for prototyping. Check out the six prototypes created during the workshop:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/5718fe1d4cb439a24c1ecb73\">Pattern Finder</a> (for Sewing, Knit and Crochet Patterns found in vintage magazines): What if as a needlework, craft or sewing enthusiast, I could search for and download vintage patterns online and experiment with them, making notes and uploading my results so other sewing crafters can get better results.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/5718ff764cb439a24c1ecb74\">Fashion Time Machine</a>: What if as a historical clothing maker, I could find instructions for any element of garments found in historic fashion exhibitions, and use multiple techniques (sewing, needlework, 3D printing) so the entire item could be faithfully reproduced - or even just my favorite parts (e.g. Valentina Project: free software for fashion pattern design).</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/5718fff84cb439a24c1ecb75\">Accessory Searches</a>: What if as a fashion or historical costume exhibit curator, I could search for important fashion accessories, and find similar relevant items and their historical reference data, so the collections I make will be beautifully coordinated as well as place and period accurate.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/571a2c2d4cb439a24c1ecb7d\">Europeana Research</a>: What if as a fashion researcher exploring Europeana as a search tool, I could perform very detailed searches and receive excellent results with many related items which could be offloaded (“pinned”) to a personal space, so my searches could be superior in accuracy and conveniently organized.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/571902a14cb439a24c1ecb77\">Fashion Pockets</a>: What if as a young fashion enthusiast, I could use an intuitive search and organization app using visual “bubbles” to collect and combine multimedia items and share with my friends to build an interesting and inspiring group of collections.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://wotify.co/projects/5719066e4cb439a24c1ecb78\">Spot It</a>: What if as a fashion enthusiast, I can use a smartphone photo to search for similar items in the Europeana database, and see how close I get to my target item, so I can share or save the images on social media.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/platoniq-workshop-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 428px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Professionals of the fashion industry came up with prototypes of products or services that re-use digital cultural heritage.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to see the results of our Fashion Heritage workshop, you'll find all the prototypes on our new <a href=\"http://wotify.co/dashboards/fashion\">Wotify dashboard site</a>.

        title: 'Try out the Europeana Annotations API'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: 'This sample use-case intends to demonstrate in a simplified way which kind of annotations you can generate for our collections.'
        body: "<p>In February, we launched an extension to the Europeana REST API: <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations\">the Annotations API</a>. Now, you can use it to generate, update and retrieve short descriptions for objects of our collections – these descriptions are called annotations. Another definition for annotations is user-contributed or system-generated enhancements, additions or corrections to metadata or media. An example (and the most well-known type) of annotation is the \"tag\", a short textual depiction about a digital resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By involving our users into improving and enhancing our data, the Annotations API creates connections across Europeana, facilitating the search and discovery of items in our systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Sample use-case: Portrait of a girl</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We have selected the lovely Russian painting below to showcase the types of annotations currently supported by Europeana Annotations API. The examples of representations that are developed here are shortened. Check out the complete versions on the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations-data-model\">Data Model</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/portrait-of-a-girl.jpg\" style=\"width: 642px; height: 738px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023831/kng_item_item_jsf_id_89.html\">Portrait of a girl</a>, unknown artist, 1800-50. Rybinsk State Architectural, Historical and Art Museum, Public Domain.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, you need to use a different<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations-getting-started\"> API key</a> (other than for the main REST API) to start experimenting with the Annotations API. You will also have access to a test environment where you can freely add annotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Simple tags</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple tag is a short textual description. How would you tag the Russian artwork? Painting, girl, flower are examples of tags that could be used. In the API: Set the \"motivation\" to \"tagging\" and set the tag as the \"body\" value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n\"motivation\": \"tagging\",\r\n\"body\": \"painting\",\r\n\"target\": \"http://data.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023831/kng_item_item_jsf_id_89\"\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Semantic tags</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A semantic tag is a tag to a resource from a controlled vocabulary, making it machine-interpretable. Currently, any URL is accepted as semantic resource. In our example, the artwork portraying a girl is related to Russia, which means we could use an URL to the Russian map as an annotation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the API: Set the \"motivation\" to \"tagging\" and set as body an object containing both @type as SpecificResource and as source the URL for the semantic resource taken from a controlled vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n\"motivation\": \"tagging\",\r\n\"body\": {\r\n\"@type\": \"SpecificResource\",\r\n\"source\": \" http://www.geonames.org/500004/rybinsk.html\"\r\n},\r\n\"target\": \"http://data.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023831/kng_item_item_jsf_id_89\"\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Object links</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An object link is a relationship between two (Europeana) objects. This relationship can be any, but it can only be made between two Europeana objects. The Russian painting above, for instance, is related to other artworks which are also from the<a href=\"http://iss.rybmuseum.ru/kng\"> Rybinsk State Architectural, Historical and Art Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the API: Set the \"motivation\" to \"linking\" and set as target an array containing the URIs of both objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Example representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n\"motivation\": \"linking\",\r\n\"target\": [\r\n\"http://data.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023831/kng_item_item_jsf_id_7\",\r\n\"http://data.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023831/kng_item_item_jsf_id_89\"\r\n]\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ready to tag away?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations-getting-started\">Get started </a>and help us testing the Annotations API! Share your opinion on <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1%20-%20!forum/europeanaap#!overview\">the Europeana API discussion group</a> or to <a href=\"http://mailto:api@europeana.eu\">api@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your feedback will be used to make improvements and add more features to the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations-roadmap-changelog\">final version to be released in 2017</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Morpheus Cup 2016: Meet the ‘Smart Culture’ champion'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>During this year’s edition of the Morpheus Cup, we introduced for the first time a competitive category named “Smart Culture”. We challenged university students from across Europe to showcase innovative re-use of Europeana Collections through imaginative and entrepreneurial solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Encouraging student entrepreneurship</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Morpheus Cup is a competition which brings together students from European universities and graduate schools to develop innovative ideas across various categories, ranging from mobility, engineering and coding to business, design, education and culture. The Cup happens in parallel with the ICT Spring Europe – one of Europe’s largest B2B ICT events, gathering 6,000 leaders, entrepreneurs, startups and investors from 72 countries. Under the patronage of the European Commission and the Government of Luxembourg, the Morpheus Cup is supported by Europeana and has as sponsors internationally known companies, such as Vodafone, ING and Deloitte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Morpheus award event took place on 10 May in Luxembourg. The finalists in each category and from the challenges on the day pitched their projects in front of all participants and an international expert jury and competed for the prize fund of 50.000 EUR (in cash, training, consultancy, materials and travel).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, eight teams from three different countries (France, Germany and Luxembourg) subscribed their proposals to compete for the ‘Smart Culture’ category. 24 students from eight different nationalities and coming from seven universities participated of the competition, presenting applications in the areas of education, health and accessibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We chose team Lyr and their project AudioSight as a winner in the Smart Culture category. Louis Chemineau, Romain Karpinski and Yelen Per from the French School of Engineering in Information Technology (TELECOM) delivered the best proposal according to the category criteria related to clear social and/or economic impact, re-use of our openly licensed content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As prize, our category winner received our recognition and also qualified as one of the finalists for the Morpheus Cup award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/team-lyr-best-smart-culture-project.jpg\" style=\"height: 428px; width: 642px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AudioSight: See with your ears</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Improve culture access for visually impaired people is the main drive of team Lyr. The three French students developed the concept for the AudioSight, an app that intends to facilitate the access to digital cultural heritage for over 30 million visually impaired people in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the team members, the current market presents solutions to extract texts regarding cultural materials, but none of these are focused on blind or partially blind people. The project will utilize the Google Vision project to retrieve information about the Europeana Collections records. And, with this information in hands, the team will produce an audio description of the artworks to be shared with visually impaired people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Lyr has envisaged about one year for developing the alpha version of their product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We congratulate the champions and hope to see their project running soon!</p>"

        title: 'Welcome to Swan Inn! Or how historical knowledge and cultural content make an intriguing virtual reality experience'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Recently, we featured the Swan Inn, a virtual reconstruction of a 17th century Flemish Inn using Europeana content on <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/virtual-17th-century-flemish-inn\">Europeana Labs</a>. We invited Daniel Pletinckx from the Belgian company <a href=\"http://heritage.visualdimension.be/\">Visual Dimension</a>, who created the web application, to share some behind-the-scenes experiences and what the future holds for their project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A guest post by Daniel Pletinckx</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the current virtual reality hype, there is a shortage of virtual reality (VR) solutions which can be experienced simultaneously by a group of people. The Belgian creative company Visual Dimension has been working on several solutions of this kind, one of them being the serious game solution <a href=\"https://enameabbey.wordpress.com/timegate/\">TimeGate</a>. This system uses natural interaction through a Kinect camera and allows school children or guided groups to explore a virtually reconstructed environment and interact with it. It can be used as an educational game, or as a virtual guided tour. The 3D walkthrough is projected on a large screen and a whole group can enjoy it. The TimeGate system is complemented by online 3D resources such as in the Swann Inn visualisation, part of the Ename 1665 project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/swan-inn.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 366px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A screenshot of the Swan inn web application.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The virtual reconstructions <a href=\"https://enameabbey.wordpress.com/1290-game/\">Ename 1290</a> and<a href=\"https://enameabbey.wordpress.com/ename-1665-game/\"> Ename 1665</a> recreate the village and the abbey of Ename in their respective periods and rely on a wide range of sources from archaeology, history and art history. The online availability of high quality resources is crucial for the efficient and scientifically correct creation of historical virtual reconstructions. Online digital libraries, such as Europeana, are today not only one of the major cornerstones of the virtual reconstruction process, but also an unprecedented dissemination channel of the resulting 3D resources, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048716/object_HA_2126.html\">this 3D reconstruction</a> of a medieval writing desk. Below some examples of how Europeana content has been used in the Ename 1665 visualisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reconstruction of an active living environment, such an inn, uses not only of physical objects that are preserved in museums (such as this <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92034/GVNRC_BVB02_F10062.html\">passglass</a>, a tall glass for drinking games popular in West and Northern Europe during 16 through 18 century), but also objects visible on<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_399.html\"> paintings</a> or described in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048319/providedCHO_3_20_17_d1e980.html\">texts</a> from the respective historical period. A realistic visualisation requires also a correct understanding of many intangible aspects, such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_3297.html\">customs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search/objects?q=RP-P-OB-76.943\">beliefs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/zoeken/objecten?q=SK-A-2362\">historical information</a>. In addition, this non-fiction information is turned into interactive storytelling, for which the 3D virtual reconstructions are only the stage. These stories can be short and simple, as in this Swann Inn Sketchfab resource, but also intricate, multi-layered stories in group games for educational purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/r3BAEI88VxQ?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=suiiX\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Enjoy a virtual tour around the Swan inn on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/70809dd7e4914a3784ba94d8840d10bf\">SketchFab</a> or on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r3BAEI88VxQ\">Youtube</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Swan Inn is only one small part of the virtual reconstruction of Ename in 1665 that is being used in multiple forms: <a href=\"https://enameabbey.wordpress.com/\">blogs</a>, <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/visualdimension\">online 3D assets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_zxw_LOKGE\">360 video</a> that can be visualised in VR headsets, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzIIosHRPgk\">interactive applications</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb41jKX9Cac\">virtual tours</a> or<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7d8w5WYpws\"> interactive educational games</a> with natural interaction. The plan is also to fund the further 3D virtual reconstruction through crowdfunding and use it together with a youth book.</p>"

        title: 'Open and transparent crowdfunding with the improved Goteo.org platform'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>A guest post by<a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/en/\"> Platoniq</a> and Goteo Foundation, as part of their involvement in the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI) project. Both organisations have been working with Europeana since 2014, designing incubation services, including co-creation, agile collaborative development, and crowdfunding for re-user communities and content holders.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowdfunding which uses a micro-donations platform to fund citizens' projects with a social impact, should be open and transparent. At least, this is what Goteo Foundation seeks by setting as its mission the promotion of a more collaborative and ethical society. This is why we are constantly looking at how to improve the technical and communicative functions of our crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been listening to our community, campaign promoters and donors. Also, we aim to reward those who use our platform by improving its design, thus making it easier to use and communicate citizens' projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are, therefore, happy to announce that our participation in Europeana DSI project has led us to introduce some new technological developments to our crowdfunding platform, which is now not only more open and transparent but also clearer, nicer and, in particular, more functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/new-goteo.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 440px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Improved Goteo.org platform, CC-BY-SA Platoniq</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information is more transparent when it is more detailed, relevant for users’ needs and accessible across diverse technological platforms. <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo.org</a> now has a responsive web application that works multi-device i.e. can be properly displayed on any type of device, incl. tablets or phones. The platform shows the relevant information by default, and allows users the ability to display extra information when required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information is more open when it is well structured and clearly communicated. The information structure of the Goteo platform is now intuitive for better usability, as items related to calls to action are more visible. When possible, key actions such as co-supporting, commenting or non-monetary contributions are divided into different processes. Also, the goals achieved are now shown differently as new stages of the project are attained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have a new way of presenting information campaigns. It is more visual, streamlined and includes new displays with three main tabs: Project, News and Participate. Each tab shows the detailed project information in a drop-down text module, a gallery with more fluid images and interactive graphic displays, offering greater clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs/blog/goteo-improvements1.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 346px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of Goteo.org, CC-BY-SA Europeana</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissemination is critical for the success of any crowdfunding campaign. We have, therefore, added two new social media sharing buttons to send campaigns to contacts directly via Telegram and Whatsapp. Users can now enjoy a more interactive website and engage with their communities via their preferred online media. And, since time is an important factor, under the \"campaign thermometer\" showing the amounts received by the campaign at every stage, we have also included a \"remind me\" button which causes the system to send an email reminding the user to make a donation before the end of a campaign they may want to support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a short summary of improvements made within the Europeana DSI project, but for a real experience of the new features, do come and visit the <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo.org platform</a>. Try it out by co-funding some projects or even by launching a campaign. If the latter is your choice, come back here soon to read more about our new 'matchfunding' programme tool where institutional or private funding is matched with crowdfunding for a multiplier effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.goteo.org\">www.goteo.org</a></p>"

        title: 'Digital games as a learning tool: an interview with Art Stories FACES'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Specialized in developing educational apps to introduce children to art, history and architecture, the Italian startup <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/\">Art Stories</a> was recently selected as one of the winners of the first <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-labs-challenge-2016-winners-announced\">Europeana Challenge of 2016</a>. This competition was the first of a series of online challenges intended to promote the innovative re-use of Europeana content.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Art Stories’ winner project FACES is a game in which users undertake simple tasks in a virtual gallery. In this digital playground, children become art explorers and are encouraged to visit museums in the real world. Here, Federica Pascotto, co-founder of Art Stories, tells us about the creative process of developing a game for a young audience and how kids can learn through play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did you apply for the Europeana Challenge?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know about Europeana because of its interesting policy on open data, so we often check the site and browse it. This is how we learnt about the challenge. Art history and heritage are the core interest of our company, so we had to apply!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did Europeana provide inspiration for your project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a huge archive, with no limits in terms of age, materials, techniques, subjects and provenance. Finding the common thread between all those artworks was a big challenge!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you choose the final paintings for the app from over 50 million items?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We almost got lost in the database, but then we narrowed the choice down to portraits and self-portraits. Then we chose contrasting artworks, trying to select artists with a different provenance and from different centuries, so as to offer a small but significant selection of European masterpieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you briefly describe the creative process that led to Art Stories FACES?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been working with our target audience well in mind. So we wondered what could be interesting and relevant for a primary school kid. We learn how to represent ourselves in school, either during art classes or in writing workshops. We thought we would try and show how many aspects of composition gather in paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did you use any particular design or UX elements for an app focused on a young audience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app combines a rich content with the rules of games: you cannot progress if you have not dealt with the current step, and you need to observe and react with a certain speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you think digital educational apps like FACES support traditional and broader learning in general?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that children learn by doing and by playing, and we have so far observed that digital games are one more tool for accessing even complex topics. We have been testing our apps in formal contexts, such as schools, and in informal settings – such as the <a href=\"https://www.alpitour.it/\">Alpitour</a> mini clubs, with whom we have just set up a partnership. In both settings, kids use apps in a very spontaneous and free way, and can remember details, situations and themes much later on. We therefore strongly believe that apps can be a great support for learning!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How the app has been received so far? What are your future plans for the game’s development?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app has been featured by Apple in the ‘Apps we love’ and in the ‘Education’ category right after its launch. It has been downloaded and played thousands of times, and we have even heard of a child commenting on a t-shirt saying ‘The colours remind me of Van Gogh’s paint strokes’! This shows how kids play, observe and learn!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have some further developments in mind: we have conceived Art Stories FACES as the first room of a virtual museum where children train on visual arts. The point of the app is making children play with specific aspects of the arts, to encourage observation and to make them confident about watching and enjoying art! You can learn something different with each painting, which you can then apply while watching artworks in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with portraits and we wish to progress with further content… maybe sculptures, or landscapes… we haven’t quite made our minds up yet! We are also considering the translation into French and Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Does this playful activity interest you? Teach the basics of visual arts to your children! Download the game on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/art-stories-faces/id1113488508?mt=8\">iTunes </a>or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artstories.faces&amp;hl=en\">Google Play</a>.</em></p>\r\n"

This information can be faceted and filtered on:</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width: 838px;\">\n<thead><tr>\n<th style=\"width: 129px;\">\r\n            <p>Information</p>\r\n            </th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 99px;\">\r\n            <p>Field in search</p>\r\n            </th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 133px;\">\r\n            <p>Field in record</p>\r\n            </th>\r\n            <th style=\"width: 443px;\">\r\n            <p>Additional logic</p>\r\n            </th>\r\n        </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 129px;\">\r\n            <p>Designer</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 99px;\">\r\n            <p>proxy_dc_creator</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 133px;\">\r\n            <p>proxies.dcCreator</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 443px;\">\r\n            <p>Designer labels are appended with \" (Designer)\"</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 129px;\">\r\n            <p>Item type</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 99px;\">\r\n            <p>proxy_dc_type</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 133px;\">\r\n            <p>proxies.dcType</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 443px;\">\r\n            <p>Labels are prepended with \"Object Type: \"</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 129px;\">\r\n            <p>Technique</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 99px;\">\r\n            <p>proxy_dc_format</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 133px;\">\r\n            <p>proxies.dcFormat</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 443px;\">\r\n            <p>Labels are prepended with \"Technique: \"</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 129px;\">\r\n            <p>Colour</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 99px;\">\r\n            <p>proxy_dc_format</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 133px;\">\r\n            <p>proxies.dcFormat</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td style=\"width: 443px;\">\r\n            <p>Labels are prepended with \"Color: \"</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In order to include filters (facets) for all these fields in a search, the following query can be used:<br><em>/search.json?wskey=xxxxx&amp;query=PROVIDER:\"Europeana Fashion\"&amp;profile=facets&amp;facet=proxy_dc_creator,proxy_dc_type.en,proxy_dc_format.en</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To search on a specific field, the following query can be used:<br><em>/search.json?wskey=xxxxx&amp;query=PROVIDER:\"Europeana Fashion\"&amp;qf=proxy_dc_type.en:\"Object Type: fashion photograph\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that when using proxy_dc_format or proxy_dc_type for search or faceting, one has to include the language as well since these labels are available in more than one language. This works with proxy_dc_format.de or proxy_dc_type.fr etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When constructing a filter (facet) with a listing of item types, techniques, colours or designers, the client application has to apply additional logic to only display the labels where the \"Additional logic\" is applied, e.g. only display creators where the label is appended with \" (Designer)\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you have any more questions, get in touch via our <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/europeanaapi\" target=\"_blank\">API forum</a>.</strong></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Europeana recently released its <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">strategic plan for 2015-2020</a>. It describes how the new technical infrastructure being built by Europeana Cloud is a key part of Europeana's upcoming work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"In the next couple of years, we hope to completely transform the aggregation process by building on our cloud infrastructure,\" says Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of Europeana Cloud for the ecosystem of aggregators and data providers is forseen as a staged process</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/cloud_at_heart_of_europeana_strategy.jpeg\" style=\"width: 999px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stage 1 </strong>shows the end of the Europeana Cloud Project. Three aggregators will be using the Cloud infrastructure: The European Library, Europeana and the Polish Digital Library Federation. These are the three aggregators who are currently building the infrastructure and will be migrating to it during the course of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>, in 2018, shows key aggregators within the Europeana eco-system making use of Europeana Cloud. Europeana will be contacting these aggregators as part of the project to find out how they might best use a shared inifrastructure such as Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>, in 2020, shows data providers to Europeana starting to use the Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long run, this new infrastructure is key to Europeana's plans to sharply increase its number of contributing partners: from 2,500 currently to 25,000 by 2020. Europeana will also use the Cloud infrastructure as a way to encourage partners to invest in Europeana itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"On the ‘supply’ side, to sustain ourselves in the future, we invite partners to become investors; co-owners of Europeana. As this is not cost effective, or indeed fair, on an individual institution basis we will seek these strategic investment partnerships at the Member State level. These investors will get access to premium services in the Europeana Cloud that allow them to move quickly from their legacy systems, share their data and content in ways that will improve the reach, data quality, and efficiency for institutions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Read Europeana's strategic plan.</a></p>"

        body: "<p>Part of the Europeana Cloud project involves the creation of Europeana Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tying it with <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>'s broader strategy of seeing itself as a platform rather than simply a search portal, Europeana Research will be a way for digitally-minded researchers in the humanities and social sciences to exploit the data provided by Europe's museums, libraries and archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A team from the project (made up of staff from CERL, Europeana, Trinity College Dublin, The European Library and the Digital Curation Unit from Athens) met this week to go through some priorities for what Europeana Research should become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/drafting_priorities_for_europeana_research_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They began sketching a wish list for features in Europeana Research, and discussed how it should differ from both the main <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana search portal</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>. There are many overlaps with the latter that need to be worked out. A preliminary list of desirable features for Europeana Research was produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/drafting_priorities_for_europeana_research_2.jpg\" style=\"height: 600px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features such as the ability to download data, find relevant tools and (as ever) higher quality metadata were perceived as being important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work will be followed up by interviews with potential users and the creation of user scenarios. These will provide the guiding detail on the type of users that will utilise Europeana Research. A first version of the platform will be available at the end of November and work will continue on it as part of the Europeana Cloud project in 2015.</p>"

        title: 'How We''re Giving Shape To The Cloud This Summer'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/how_we_re_giving_shape_to_the_cloud_this_summer.jpeg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 210px; float: right;\">The first half of the Europeana Cloud project has seen plenty of discussion about the shape of the project. Those discussions are now feeding into the creation of some key publications, which will further clarify the structure of the Europeana Cloud service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Cloud Access Framework</strong> will determine the data policy for Europeana Cloud. It will answer questions such as: <em>What metadata formats can be accepted into Europeana Cloud?</em> What is the maximum size for any content being shared? <em>What level of permissions can be set on the metadata and content in Europeana Cloud?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Operating Guidelines</strong> will provide further advice to aggregators wishing to use Europeana Cloud: <em>How they upload data?</em> Where it will be stored? <em>How do they become members of Europeana Cloud?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Cost Model</strong> outlines the costs for becoming a member of Europeana Cloud: <em>What costs will be paid by Europeana as part of Connecting Europe Facility?</em> How will aggregators be billed? <em>Can aggregators pay with staff time?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These documents will later be joined by one on <strong>Governance Structure</strong> that will determine how the Europeana Cloud service is run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help prepare all of these documents, members of both Europeana Cloud's strategic and technical work packages (WPs 2 and 5) will come together in three separate workshops. (Project Partners can see further details <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/1768384/projects/2256732/messages/26518416\">on our internal site</a>; login required)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect to complete the first versions of these documents towards the end of the summer, and will make them public on the website. It is envisaged that these documents will be updated as the project continues, in particular to take on board feedback from the other project members and from aggregators in the Europeana eco-system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewmorrell/88757262/in/photostream/\">Andrew Morrell</a>, CC BY-ND.</em></p>"

        body: "<p>The Europeana Cloud project is currently developing a shared infrastructure with 3 specific aggregators (The European Library, The Polish Library Digital Federation and Europeana itself). But<strong> the ambition is to build eCloud as a sustainable service that can cater for the data management needs of other aggregators</strong> who provide to Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of Europeana Aggregators’ Forum in May 2014, the Europeana Cloud project hosted a workshop to explore what these other aggregators might benefits and difficulties they might see in such a service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5591/14269656531_851f224d99.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delegates representing aggregators from the Latvia, Germany, the UK, Spain and the Czech Republic were amongst those present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order of frequency,<strong> some of the key benefits cited by the delegates were</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Data storage / management</strong> - The ability for aggregators to have a better system for storing and managing their data</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Aggregation to Europeana</strong> - The potential for eCloud to provide a clear process for aggregation to Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Greater potential for re-use of metadata and content</strong> - The possibility for data to be published once and then re-used many times</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Enrichment Tools</strong> - The potential for tools to be built on top of Europeana Cloud that will help to improve metadata quality for multiple aggregators</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Costs </strong>- A shared infrastructure will save costs</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14086326958_c573a85d6b.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And the potential problems were</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Policy</strong> - If eCloud permits aggregators to share data in different formats and quality, will it not just end up containing poor quality data?</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Costs / Sustainability</strong> - What happens to the shared eCloud if Europeana stops or changes direction?</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Management and Governanc</strong>e - Difficult to work out precise roles of data providers, aggregators and Europeana in a shared system</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Aggregation to Europeana</strong> - Will eCloud actually add an extra layer of bureaucracy in sharing data?</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Understanding of the eCloud Concept</strong> - the concept of 'cloud in general is nebulous, and difficult to define in context of other Cloud services.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>During the second half of the project (August 2014 - January 2016),<strong> there will be more structured dialogue with the aggregators to help develop Europeana Cloud</strong>. This will help provider further information on the issues and help address the potential problems. By the end of 2015, Europeana will be in the position to deliver its shared infrastructure as a service to help all aggregators.</p>"

        title: 'Q&A: Partner Profile - The European Library'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14034772030_01f6fac60f.jpg\" style=\"float: right; height: 301px; width: 200px;\">The European Library is the coordinator of the Europeana Cloud project and one of three partners who will initially test our new Cloud infrastructure. Recently we caught up with Director Louise Edwards, who told us why Europeana Cloud is so valuable for The European Library, for researchers and for the cultural heritage community as a whole.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is The European Library and what role does it play within the Europeana Cloud project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a> takes in metadata from Europe’s libraries and forwards it to Europeana. We have multiple roles within the Europeana Cloud project. We are the project coordinator, responsible for making sure that all partners pull together strategically and that the project works as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also one of the three main aggregators of the project, along with the <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/owoc\">Polish Digital Libraries Federation</a>, a national aggregator in Poland, and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>, thesuper-aggregator for all of Europe’s cultural metadata. Together we’re working to develop a shared infrastructure that all three of us can use. Once the project is finished, this infrastructure will be broadened and opened up to other aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will this new infrastructure change the way that The European Library works?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment each aggregator is running different hardware and software, and our data sits in different places. We can’t share data without going through a time-consuming process of importing and exporting data. It can take time to change formats, it can take time to pass the data from A to B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Cloud, we’ll have a shared infrastructure where it’s much easier to get hold of the data, to share it and to use it in different ways. Imagine a shared network drive within an office, which allows you to access anyone else’s data within the office and to take that data and use or share it for any purpose. At a very simple level, that’s what we’re doing within Europeana Cloud– although there will be greater controls on how different users can use the data</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What value will this new shared infrastructure have for The European Library?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a start, the Cloud should help to reduce our costs. We currently spend a lot of time forwarding data to Europeana, sending it from our system to their system. There’s a real friction cost involved in passing this data around. If we are running the same system, less time will be taken to speak technically to Europeana. It will be much easier for them to access and harvest our data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also allow The European Library to better enrich that data, transform it and allow other people to build tools on top of that data so it becomes much more open. As an example, one of the things we’re really interested in is a tool for entity extraction. That’s where you have computers recognise names and locations within data. If someone were to build this tool within the Cloud, we could use it to enrich all or some of the data and then feed the data back into our own portal or share it in other ways to benefit users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key here is that the Cloud will give us a two-way process of updating and enriching content and then creating subsets that are useful for different types of end user groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is it important to divide data up into different categories or subsets in the first place?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana provides access to 30 million records which you can search. That volume of data is wonderful but it also makes it difficult to find material related to precise topics or to locate types of data such as sounds. What the Cloud will allow people to do is to pre-select various parts of the data and to build tools on top of those separate indexes of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me give you an example. Imagine a researcher who discovers a collection of letters from a famous politician. Under the current system, the researcher can’t download the data and the only tools he can use to analyse the collection are the ones provided by the aggregator (in this case Europeana). Europeana Cloud offers a platform, to get access to the letters and to build a tool to transcribe the letters. He could then return the transcriptions to the Cloud so that so that everyone can have access to that new and enhanced data. By everyone, we mean not only other researchers but also the original institution that provided the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there similar Cloud projects to this one at the moment or is it unique?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is quite unique in terms of cultural heritage. There are similar projects in different fields. <a href=\"http://www.eudat.eu/\">EUDAT</a>, for example, is building a distributed structure for sharing scientific research data related to subject areas such as Climate Modeling and Human Physiology. They need much more complex controls related to authorisation and authentication because there are data protection issues but the concept of sharing data over a common infrastructure with different groups is essentially the same as Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When will people be able to access the Cloud?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first experience many people will have of the cloud is through the prototype tools we are building for specific communities. We already have <a href=\"http://greenlearningnetwork.com/axiom/\">a tool for early modern philosophy</a> and this year we’re using data in Europeana to build a specific tool for people working in musicology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the project, we’ll have APIs or data dumps that will allow people to access the data in the cloud, take away what they’re interested in and build tools using the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through all of these ways, we’re showing how Europeana Cloud can be valuable in segmenting data for specific communities, rather than putting the focus on millions of pieces of data which nobody can really search through effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To learn more about Europeana Cloud, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeana_cloud\">follow us on Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/newsletter\">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</em></p>"

We also spoke about how the infrastructure being built by Europeana Cloud could help content providers to reach new audiences, provide more services to users and to enrich their data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of tools, we made plans to collect user stories, to create materials such as infographics and to assemble clearer information on our website, including a section aimed an organisations interested in using our new cloud technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to this workshop, the members of Work Package 6 (the communications work group of Europeana Cloud) now have a better understanding of the information and materials they need to gather so that the work being done by Europeana Cloud can be shared with the widest possible audience over the coming months.

To achieve this, we need the help of all data providers to both Europeana and The European Library to complete a survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/12946964205_ebccbb1603_z.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know your dataset contents and subject strengths better than we as project partners could and we would like to have the best possible information on your datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information about the content of your datasets will help us to improve knowledge and awareness of the digital objects housed in Europeana. This in turn will help us to further the development of Europeana Research by charting and enhance our offering to the research community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the survey will be used to take a closer look at how we can serve the research community best. This is due to happen in the second half of the Europeana Cloud project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All contributors to Europeana have received an invitation to fill in the survey, either directly or through their aggregators.

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>What will Europeana Cloud’s new infrastructure look like? How will Europeana and its aggregators benefit? What about version control? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answers to these questions are laid out in our report: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fdocuments%2F1414567%2F1861920%2FD2.2%2BEuropeana%2BCloud%2BArchitectural%2BDesign&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYzs89XWUIANN6vjpNdxOSMIhRUg\">Europeana Cloud Architectural Design</a> and the key points are also now available through four graphics. They look at the cloud from four perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Aggregators</strong> - What do the three main aggregators involved in Europeana Cloud want from the project? Some of the potential benefits include a new place for data storage, flexible data processing capabilities and the ability to track changes and versions of digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/12630833964_b30dc4464f_b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Service Models</strong> - A service model outlines how the cloud provider and the users will interact. Europeana Cloud will mainly use two models: Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This graphic explains why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/12630415395_2c5f170c2d_b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Version Control</strong> - All versions of content uploaded to Europeana Cloud will have their own unique ID numbers which are linked to one another. Content providers will always keep full control of their own versions in the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/12630416245_69ca4e45bf_b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Cloud Types</strong> - Europeana Cloud will be built as a Hybrid infrastructure, combining the best features of both Public and Private clouds. On the private side, data providers will be able to access the cloud via an API from systems installed in their data centres. We will dip into the public cloud as needed, for example if it makes financial sense to do so, and will develop advanced tools to manage resource allocation and data transfers between the two cloud types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/12630833904_668f078b27_b.jpg\" /></p>"

        body: "<p>One of the ambitions of Europeana Cloud is to provide a resource and tools to help humanities researchers with their work. In order to do this, the project has undertaken research to find out what tools these researchers already use, what they would like to use, how Europeana can help them today and what changes need to be made to better help them in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several Expert Forums have taken place in order to gather this information, with humanities researchers from seven countries giving their feedback and generating ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what did our researchers say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, they told us about the tools they already use for research and collaboration, which include mainstream services such as: Google (including cloud services like Google Drive); social media like Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest; Microsoft Office products and open source alternatives; specialised research tools such as Open Refine (formerly, Google Refine), R as an interface to query and analyse text corpora statistically, tools for authorship attribution, GIS applications (or QGIS, an open source alternative) and annotation tools. There were also a range of tools tailored to specific topic areas. for some subjects within biblical studies, a geographic visualization tool, ‘eResearch’; for oral history (interviews, audiovisual), a bilingual platform for voice and speech recognition, with full transcription and OCR functionalities, materials will be exported to XML and saved in a data archive in the Netherlands; in musicology, a self-built tool to help with OMR processes (Optical Music Recognition) applied to 16th-century music manuscripts and early printed music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six specialisms within the humanities field were identified as areas in which Europeana content could potentially aid researchers: archaeology, history, law, linguistics, musicology and philosophy. During the Expert Forums, researchers played the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/1977648\">Europeana Treasure Hunt</a> to familiarise themselves with the Europeana portal, in order to be able to provide feedback on how they think it could help them both now and in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/researchers_tell_us_how_to_turn_europeana_into_research_tool.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 656px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Example of an item of interest to humanities researchers. '<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/ark__12148_btv1b8443886c.html\">Tableau et carte psycho philosophique de l'Europe en 1906 / Conçue... par Metz-Masson</a>', French National Library, public domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having had a chance to check out Europeana, the general consensus was that while all agreed that Europeana is a great instrument for showing the diversity of Europeana culture, at present, it can only serve as a generic discovery service for developing an impression of 'what is out there' and that content from Europeana would need to be exported out of the portal and into the systems used by researchers where it could be analysed and manipulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make Europeana into a research tool, the group made the following key recommendations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>adding and logging user comments, accommodating user-enhanced metadata;</li>\r\n    <li>boosting import and export possibilities;</li>\r\n    <li>enhancing search functionality and filtering functionality;</li>\r\n    <li>moving from exploration and discovery to in-depth descriptions and interconnectedness;</li>\r\n    <li>stepping up development for interaction and connection with users / user groups.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So what happens next?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feedback from Expert Forums such as this one will provide important information for the further development of the project Work Package that is looking at exploiting Europeana Cloud with services and tools for researchers. This will be discussed at the Plenary Assembly of the project in March in Athens. Additional input for these exchanges will come from another major report from WP1 - 'Exploring Innovative Tools in Humanities and Social Sciences Research' - which is nearing completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more - read the whole report: '<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/1915215/D1.5+Third+Expert+Forum+-+Tools+%26+Content+for+Humanities+Research\">D1.5 Expert Forum Tools &amp; Content for Humanities Research Report</a>'</p>"

        title: 'Answers To Your Questions About Europeana Cloud'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Will the Europeana Cloud service be free? </strong><em>What types of metadata will be accepted? </em><strong>Will the documentation and standards developed through the project be Open Source so that others can benefit from them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were a few of the many questions posed by around 60 cultural heritage professionals at the latest Europeana Cloud workshop, which took place in Rotterdam as part of Europeana's Annual General Meeting (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/ecloud-locloudplenarynov2013\">see the presentation from the event</a> by project co-ordinator Alastair Dunning).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/11203799506_5c2f764a6f_z.jpg\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/11203799506_5c2f764a6f_z.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Asking questions at the Europeana Cloud workshop at Europeana's 2013 AGM.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We're currently working to update the Europeana Cloud website with answers to many of these Frequently Asked Questions. In the meantime, we've selected four questions from the workshop to answer here, in this blog post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q1. Who is Europeana Cloud for? </strong><br />\r\nThe first versions of Europeana Cloud will be for the three aggregators in the project: The European Library, the Polish Digital Library Federation and Europeana itself. Europeana Cloud aims to be a data storage platform that replaces their current systems. As Europeana Cloud develops, we will open membership to aggregators and cultural heritage organisations (likely in early 2016). They will be able to use the cloud to upload and share metadata and content among members. Finally, data will also be made available to end users via APIs and third-party tools, according to access conditions stipulated by the data provider.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Q2. Will the Europeana Cloud service be free? </strong><br />\r\nThe business model underpinning the service is still being developed. We'll aim to make many features and services available for free or at a minimal cost, however it's unlikely that we'll be able to offer free storage for content providers. Our goal is to develop a system that offers clear value-for-money over existing options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q3. What types of metadata will be accepted and under what license? </strong><br />\r\nThat needs to be decided through consultation with project partners, potential content providers and the researchers who we hope will use the content. We naturally would like as much of the content as possible to be available under a CC0, to enable re-use by the research community. Equally, we are aware that some types of metadata (eg. rich geotagged metadata) may require difference licenses and will be exploring the issues around that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Q4. Will Europeana Cloud make its documentation and standards Open Source?</strong><br />\r\nYes! We will adhere to the spirit of all Europeana projects and make as much of our work Open Source as possible.

        body: "<p>By Vicky Garnett, Trinity College Dublin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve all been there - sitting in a meeting staring at a 20-slide-long PowerPoint presentation, trying so hard to concentrate but quietly counting down the minutes until the coffee break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, during the development of the first Europeana Cloud Expert Forum, Trinity College Dublin (TCD) devised a weapon against the Coffee-Break Countdown Syndrome: the Europeana Treasure Hunt!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana_treasure_hunt_1.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 872px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognising that our participants probably wouldn’t have had time to take a good look at Europeana (or might not even have heard of it), we came up with a quick, simple, and hopefully entertaining way to allow everyone to get to know Europeana and some of its features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the first Europeana Cloud Expert Forum was to evaluate Europeana in its current form, and to imagine case studies of what Europeana could be following the completion of the project. But it seemed unreasonable to ask people to discuss this without first giving them the opportunity to see Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing the Treasure Trail</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana_treasure_hunt_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 800px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dublin Expert Forum, photo by Vicky Garnett</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Expert Forum time was at a premium. The game took no more than 30 minutes including playing and feedback time. In order to see current features, all teams started by creating a My Europeana profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game contained questions on using multiple search terms for the same event, such as the First World War. We found that different terms brought up different results - something for us to discuss later on in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We knew that the disparity in metadata fields was an issue, so the second question offered players one point for every item they found in Europeana with 11 or more completed metadata fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, working on the same principle as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack\">Googlewhacks</a>, teams were asked to use the search function to try to find the most specific items they could, with the highest scores going to search terms of 2-5 words that could produce just one item. A search term that provided only one result was therefore deemed a Europeanawhack!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game received much positive feedback from the participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Treasure Hunt 2.0</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana_treasure_hunt_3.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 596px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amsterdam Expert Forum, photo by Agiati Benardou</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the success of the game in Dublin - it was called for again in the second Expert Forum in Gothenberg (UGOT) in October 2013. This meeting had a slightly different remit to the first - identifying the content and tools that could be used in Europeana. So UGOT took the basic principles of the game and modified the questions so it focused on content types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This version was also used in the Expert Forum in Amsterdam, again providing the same space for discussion among the players.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Treasure Hunt 3.0?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So where do we go from here? The game was designed as an ice-breaker but it has proven to be a useful tool for researchers unfamiliar with Europeana. Perhaps this could become a permanent feature of Europeana as a means to introduce new users to the portal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/aeeeb161-4a1c-4f85-8a6d-4068d89acec0\">Download the Europeana Treasure Hunt rules.</a><br />\r\nWe'd love to hear your feedback - please email vicky.garnett@tcd.ie!</p>"

        title: 'State of the art report on digital research practices, tools and scholarly content use'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Blog by Agiati Benardou, Research Associate at the Digital Curation Unit of the R.C. 'Athena', Institute for the Management of Information Systems.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, Work Package 1 (Assessing Researchers’ Needs in the Cloud and Ensuring Community Engagement) officially submitted one of its major deliverables, D1.2, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/6b6482e6-1e89-4d8b-9690-bce23598f73f\"><em>State of the Art Report on Digital Research Practices, Tools and Scholarly Content Use</em></a>. The significance of this report lies in the fact that it sets the basis for a user-centred, evidence-based approach to User Requirements elicitation and analysis for the future Europeana Research platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This quite extensive piece of work constitutes desk research aiming to present and analyse the current situation related to digital research practices, tools and content for the Humanities and Social Sciences research communities. Furthermore, it serves as the theoretical framework towards the development of a content strategy for Europeana Research as well as the identification and analysis of user requirements for Humanities and Social Sciences in the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/state_of_the_art_report_on_digital_research_practices_tools_and_scholarly_content_use.jpg\" style=\"width: 1000px; height: 815px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Eliza Papaki (DCU, \"Athena\" R.C.) and Owain Roberts (NLW), two of the main authors of the 'State of the art report on digital research practices, tools and scholarly content use', photo taken by Alastair Dunning.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purposes of this report, our research was carried out as an exploration stage which would then provide the basis for the confirmation stage, namely a web survey. The latter was based on previous work in the context of user requirements research within two ESFRI e-Infrastructures projects - 'Preparing DARIAH' and the 'European Holocaust Research Infrastructure' (EHRI). This web survey aims to produce an evidence-based, statistically valid and reliable descriptive record of scholarly practice and digital needs in the Humanities and Social Sciences within the Europeana ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, this report relies heavily on work previously presented in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/23f1ea1c-3e17-465a-88c8-8db616cb1452\"><em>Research Communities Identification and Definition Report</em></a>, submitted last June, in which the Humanities and Social Sciences research communities to be supported via Europeana Cloud were comprehensively discussed and identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, this report illustrated that the rise of digital content and its gradual adoption from researchers in the humanities and social sciences has inevitably brought changes in the research practices and user behaviour. Despite the fact that user information behaviour literature, aiming to grasp the impact of the digital age in research, is a growing field, scholarly content use is only studied in the context of more general topics. The shift in digital tools to web-based technologies only adds to these complexities. Therefore, further research in this particular field will illuminate and direct efforts to build research infrastructures which will best serve research needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/6b6482e6-1e89-4d8b-9690-bce23598f73f\">State of the Art Report on Digital Research Practices, Tools and Scholarly Content Use</a></em> was the joint effort of four partners in the Project, the Digital Curation Unit ('Athena' R.C.), CERL, the National Library of Wales and the University of Gothenburg.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"

        title: 'Debating legal and economic requirements for Europeana Cloud'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>We recently told you about the outcomes of the workshop that explored <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/determining-the-social-principles-of-europeana-cloud\">the social principles of Europeana Cloud</a>. Today, we are describing the discussions that took place during two consecutive workshops, hosted by the University of Edinburgh, that focused on establishing the legal and economic requirements of Europeana Cloud. The anticipated outcome of the workshops was to gain a better understanding of stakeholders' expectations and requirements, and as any discussion around Europeana Cloud proves, there was a lot to talk about!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/debating_legal_and_economic_implications_for_cloud.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 353px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><em>'<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/09428/suub_hist_index_jsp_id_V_2_a_235_1117.html\">Edinburgh</a>', Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen</em><em> and EuropeanaLocal Deutschland, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 1: Key questions regarding the legal principles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with the Legal Principles: we all understand that Europeana Cloud will need a set of rules, agreements and possibly a legal framework to manage and guide the interactions between stakeholders and the exchange of metadata, tools and services, but we don’t know exactly what is required. This is the main question we wanted the workshop participants to address - but finding the way to proceed is not as simple as asking the questions, collecting the answers and writing a set of agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nHowever, asking this key question is a good place to start, so we asked participants to identify the legal issues they anticipated Europeana Cloud would address. This raised questions such as who would be legally responsible for Europeana Cloud and how access to the metadata, tools and services would be managed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nHow open should Europeana Cloud be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to give the participants as much information as possible to refine their issues, we introduced two additional perspectives: Pavel Kats from Europeana, responsible for the development of the technical infrastructure <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud-shared-infrastructure-for-european-cultural-content.%20%20\">described the current design</a> and how it would<a href=\"http://prezi.com/lkrzlnfduvpy/europeana-cloud/\"> enable relationships between stakeholders.</a> Following this, Paul Keller from Kennisland, described the ongoing developments to the Europeana Licensing Framework, the introduction of the Content Re-Use Framework and the<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/e-commerce/directive/index_en.htm\"> legislative requirements </a>that will need to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThese presentations activated a lively and elaborate debate about legal requirements and issues. One particular recurring point of debate was used as the basis of an exercise to describe the ideal scenarios which addressed how open should Europeana Cloud be, who should have access to the metadata, and who can use it and on what terms. Interestingly, these scenarios yielded very different results from the workshop participants with one clear point of common ground: all groups were in favour of Europeana Cloud enabling open access; the consensus was that compromises would need to be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThese points of view, as well as a number of unanswered questions that were raised throughout the day were taken forward into the next workshops, which took a closer look at the economic benefits of participating in Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/debating_legal_and_economic_implications_for_cloud_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 601px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nDay 2: The benefits of the future business model of Europeana Cloud</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Led by our resident expert on business models, Harry Verwayen, the second day's workshop was all about identifying the opportunities Europeana Cloud represents. We introduced illustrator <a href=\"http://www.jamvisualthinking.com/people/12\">Herman Weeda</a> into the day's proceedings, who helped us visualise the complex discussions by sketching the future cloud, its processes and issues. We also heard about the perspective of the Danish Museums from Merete Sanderhoff, Statens Museum, who are working towards a more open oriented business model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe workshop took us through a series of discussions based on the four key benefit-based stakeholders priorities: lowering costs, increasing effectiveness, delivering efficiencies and improving dissemination. For example, one benefit was defined as ‘increasing find- and usability’ of metadata and content. The opportunity would be to create an easy to use and practical API for Europeana Cloud benefiting researchers, other end-users, and data providers as it would allow their metadata and content to be used more often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nForming of the Strategic Task Force</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we navigated through the ranges of benefits we perceived, we also challenged participants to identify what they didn’t know about Europeana Cloud and its offerings. Looking at Herman's penultimate illustration of the mechanisms involved in delivering the tools and services of Europeana Cloud enabled a fuller debate of where the blurry parts of his picture were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/debating_legal_and_economic_implications_for_cloud_3.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 599px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAnd so the first issues for the Europeana Cloud Strategic Task Force were formed. Composed of active and engaged members of the workshops, the Task Force is challenged to provide best case scenarios that help shape issues related to metadata and content, storage, access, value proposition and sustainability. This Task Force will run over the coming months, developing scenarios and contributing to the refinement of the set of requirements that result from this series of workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe end result will be a defined, debated and refined set of requirements presented to the Europeana Cloud Plenary in February 2014. These requirements form the foundation of the governance and legal frameworks that will be developed as well as the business models designed to deliver the efficiencies and the sustainability promised by Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\_</p>"

        title: 'Imagining Europeana Cloud for Researchers in the Social Sciences'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Written by Susan Reilly of <a href=\"http://www.libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a>, a Europeana Cloud project partner.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the roles of the Europeana Cloud project is to identify and assess the needs of researchers from the humanities and social sciences domains in relation to the cloud, and to ensure the wider research community has a chance to engage with the construction of the cloud. By exploring how researchers could potentially interact with and use <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> content, we will be able to build a solid content strategy for the aggregation of research content. We will also ensure that the technical architecture of Europeana Cloud and related tools are developed to meet these needs. This work to engage the research community, increase their awareness of Europeana, and gather input regarding the usefulness of the content and requirements for tools is being done through four expert forums, the most recent of which was hosted by the University of Gothenburg on 24-25th October, 2013. <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/10591332324_53c18e8e86_z.jpg\" style=\"height: 600px; width: 800px; float: left;\"><em>Discussing the cloud at a workshop in Sweden. Photograph by Norman Rodger.</em> The meeting was attended by group of Europeana Cloud partners and researchers from across Europe. The participants' research interests ranged from gender studies, to economics, to information interaction. Together they discussed and interacted with the Europeana portal and scoped tools for Europeana Cloud. The forum kicked off with what is fast becoming a staple feature of our expert forums, the Europeana treasure hunt. Designed as a quick way of familiarising participants with Europeana and as an ice-breaker, the reluctance of participants to cease in their treasure hunt efforts showed that social scientists are no less competitive than their humanities counter parts. With this basic introduction to Europeana and its content complete, the forum changed focus to explore what tools are used by social scientists and what tools they might use to exploit Europeana content. The experts listed a vast array of tools for both quantitative and qualitative research. They also listed a large number of tools for collaboration. The experts felt they primarily needed visualisation, analysis, and mining tools to exploit Europeana content. All of the experts felt that tools for evaluation of the content was of high importance. The discussion of tools to evaluate content led nicely into the second breakout session of the expert forum, which took place the following morning and focused on content. This was a slightly more difficult discussion. The experts felt that Europeana did not necessarily need more content but rather more quality content and mechanisms which could be used to evaluate the content coverage and gaps, depth, quality, origin and relevance. One interesting suggestion was that Europeana should start promoting content to the researcher by formulating research questions that could be explored through the Europeana corpus and encouraging researchers to conduct this research. Overall, the key message from the expert forum was that Europeana Cloud does not need to answer all research questions or have comprehensive coverage to be useful to the social scientist. It does, however, need to be transparent about the coverage that it does have and engender trust in the content by enabling the user to evaluate it.</p>"

        title: 'Determining the Social Principles of Europeana Cloud'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> is a project that is creating a shared hosting and computing infrastructure for the cultural sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday 18 September, Europeana Cloud organised a workshop hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam to discuss the social principles of Europeana Cloud - the principles that govern how stakeholders, such as data providers and users, should interact and collaborate with each other. The goal of the day was to find out the stakeholders' requirements for the cloud, in order to ensure that Europeana Cloud is built to suit the cultural sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/determining_the_social_principles_of_europeana_cloud.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 650px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/collectie_SK_C_5.html\">Nachtwacht</a>' by Rembrandt, Rijksmuseum, public domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day started with a brief tour of the newly reopened Rijksmuseum. Interesting little fact: Did you know that the famous Night Watch by Rembrandt has its own escape hatch? It was built in the 1930s to use in case of emergency. The painting slips down through the hatch into a cycle path that cuts under and through the Rijksmuseum!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this great ice-breaker, we went to work exploring the many different types of social principles that should govern Europeana Cloud in a day-long creative brainstorm. These principles are a more concrete implementation of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud%3A-establishing-the-high-level-principles\">Europeana Cloud High Level Principles</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principles that were discussed were wide and varied: enlarging the research community that uses heritage data and content; increasing the number of citations of cultural works; tailoring access to parts of collections according to defined user groups; having higher quality content and metadata (through sharing and enrichment possibilities); having more content to make it more cost-efficient for data providers; having cheap storage; and having metrics to see how data/content is being used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/determining_the_social_principles_of_europeana_cloud_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 411px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph of the workshop, by Julia Fallon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one key principle that kept cropping up was the idea that Europeana Cloud needs to be governed by its stakeholders. This notion of a shared ownership of Europeana Cloud is in line with the Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/cultural-commons\">Cultural Commons principles</a>. It means that each data provider not only owns and controls their own data on the cloud, but they also participate in determining how other users interact with the tools and services available through Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was agreed that these tools and services should enable efficient online storage and the sharing of cultural heritage content with users, including other institutions and researchers. This should be enabled through a suite of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allows different groups of users to create new tools and services on top of the data stored in Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operating under a coherent governance model, and a robust technical infrastructure, Europeana Cloud should deliver easier ways of publishing datasets to a sharing platform, one which also shows the authority and integrity of its providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a lot of requirements identified and debated, we moved on to mapping the key requirements against the level of impact they would have. The results from this were used as the basis for the following two workshops addressing the legal and economic principles, which will be further summarised within WP5 Deliverable D5.1 which translates the output of the workshops into the 'minimum requirements for Europeana Cloud'. More on the following two workshops shortly!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>By Susan Reilly, EU Projects Officer at LIBER, one of the partners in the Europeana Cloud Project.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘A picture paints a thousand words’ but can a picture capture the concept behind a project as ambitious and wide ranging as Europeana Cloud?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/10154265324_feb6a416a9_z.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Drawing high-level concepts can be helpful to clarify ideas.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now in its 8th month, the project is tasked with establishing a cloud-based infrastructure for Europeana and its aggregators and with facilitating access to content and tools for researchers. This is an enormous task, which requires consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest round of consultation happened in Edinburgh, Scotland in October. Content providers, research infrastructures, aggregators and researchers came together to focus on the economic principles underpinning Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of the Cloud was discussed from the perspective of each of the stakeholders. Who benefits, and where does the funding come from? As the discussion progressed, an illustrator was on hand to capture and visualise the ideas and to draw out the values of the Cloud for each of the stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translating the discussion in to something visual led to the identification of problems as well as misunderstandings. That one person with a pen and paper was able to encapsulate what twenty five people had talked through over the course of a few hours was astonishing. We were, at least in a literal sense, on the same page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5326/10154238534_440af3dfd1_z.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Discussing the Cloud at a recent workshop in Edinburgh, Scotland.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visualisation renewed and clarified discussions and helped us to agree further actions to be taken. There are few things more amorphous than a cloud and the concept of a Cloud based infrastructure is a difficult one to thrash through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a simple tool such as illustration can make a huge difference in terms of achieving clarity and focusing discussions. It’s a tool I would highly recommend to anyone struggling to reach consensus around high level concepts.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Cloud - Shared Infrastructure for European Cultural Content'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>By Pavel Kats, Europeana Development Manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless you've been living in a cave for the last few years, you've probably noticed that cloud computing technologies are rapidly transforming our lives. Cloud computing, or 'the cloud', for simplicity, have become buzzwords in everyday talk - every kid on the block knows that there are things out there 'in the cloud' and they are supposed to be safer, cheaper and ever accessible with just an internet connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To bring the European cultural heritage sector and these recent technological innovations together, the European Commission has sponsored the Europeana Cloud project. Its main goal is to take advantage of recent advances in cloud computing technology and to create a cloud-based digital, trusted infrastructure for aggregating European cultural heritage content. The vision is that adopting the infrastructure will result in an overall economy of scale in IT costs, flexible allocation of computing and storage resources, and improved access to shared metadata and content for both people and compatible tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task of building the infrastructure was assigned to one of the project's work packages (WP2). Three major European aggregators - the Europeana Foundation, the European Library and Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center - partner with Istituto della Scienza e Tecnologie della Informazione from Pisa, Italy and the Open University, UK. Half a year into the project, the partners have released the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/results/-/document_library_display/p6BV/view/1861920/57410?_110_INSTANCE_p6BV_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-cloud%2Fresults%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2Fp6BV%2Fview%2F1861920\">first version of the design of the future system</a> and switched to the implementation phase. In this blog post, we'd like to tell you about the essentials of this design, to promote further discussion on it and to encourage cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conceptual diagram below features the main components of the future system. At its foundation is a set of data centres, each one set up and administered by one of the institutions. The centres are consolidated into a unified infrastructure which provides database, storage and computation resources for applications and services. At the initial stage, the underlying physical resources of various types, represented in the diagram by colour-coding, will be provided by the founding institutions in accordance with their expertise and IT constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana_cloud_shared_infrastructure_for_european_cultural_content_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 552px; float: left;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/b6530e50-3673-40b9-8a86-98becd71bba3\">Download a larger version of this diagram</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of the resource infrastructure, a set of software services will be developed. The services, described in detail in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/results/-/document_library_display/p6BV/view/1861920/57410?_110_INSTANCE_p6BV_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-cloud%2Fresults%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2Fp6BV%2Fview%2F1861920\">design deliverable</a>, will be accessible via a set of standardised REST APIs and form a service suite providing basic functionality for aggregation and storage of metadata and content by aggregators. The aggregators will use APIs encapsulating these services to build tools supporting their specialised aggregation flows. The project will develop basic ingestion tools to showcase the potential of the platform and to encourage its adoption by the aggregators. In this vein, the Europeana Cloud infrastructure will be a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform providing aggregation services and tools, storage used by these services, and computation resources allowing them to run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faithful to the spirit of Europeana to promote open-source software, the project will use and develop open-source tools and components. The domain of cloud computing and cloud services has recently seen a huge amount of open-source development and some projects have reached the level of maturity where they can now compete with and beat commercial vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology choices made by the infrastructure team to start building the system reflect the decision to be on the forefront of innovation without compromising on maturity of the solutions: Europeana Cloud will use the popular Apache Cassandra distributed database to store metadata and OpenStack, the hottest name in the cloud technology world, for its storage and computation layers. Naturally, the list of used solutions will evolve during the project's lifetime. The software developed by the project will be open-source as well, allowing for easy external contribution by the community and for easy standalone installations exploiting some of the features of the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main themes of cloud computing in general and of Europeana Cloud in particular is cost efficiency for users achieved through consolidation of resources and economy of scale. Institutional and project aggregators will save on IT infrastructure maintenance costs through switching to Europeana Cloud. To sustain the infrastructure beyond the project's lifetime, several sustainability models will be proposed by another part of the project (WP5). Apart from the option to cover the costs directly by paying, institutions will be able to contribute their IT resources to the distributed infrastructure. To ensure the required level of reliability of infrastructure components, a set of SLAs (Service Level Agreements) will be developed and imposed on new joiners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another motivation for cloud computing which is going to be explored by the project is flexibility. The idea is that there is no need for constant provision of infrastructure components to support occasional spikes of activity. Instead, these components can be provided temporarily and disposed of when not needed. This allows for flexible pay-as-you-go cost schemes and easier resource planning for organisations. Europeana Cloud will investigate the applicability of such schemes in the cultural heritage domain by maintaining a part of its infrastructure in a public cloud and adding it to the main system as a 'flexible' component which can be extended on-demand to accommodate spikes of activity. A standard use-case envisioned to justify this need are periodical resource-intensive publication cycles which many aggregators maintain to publish new content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important audience which will be addressed by the project are humanities and social science researchers. Despite ubiquitous digital innovation in research and a multitude of new tools being developed for humanity scholars, the usability of these tools is severely limited. Due to many factors, such as incompatible data formats, limited technical or legal accessibility to relevant content, technical hurdles of various kinds, knowledge barriers, and others, there is no free encounter yet between tools and content. The herculean task of enabling this encounter will be addressed by the Europeana Research portal, an extension of the European Library portal, which will be built on top of the Europeana Cloud infrastructure by the project (in WP3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, Europeana Cloud is a complex technical project with a heterogenous group of stakeholders. We are encouraged by the availability of mature cloud technologies, by overwhelming adoption of these technologies by other industries and by a shared understanding that the time has come to foster this adoption in the cultural heritage sector. It is through the joint effort of different stakeholders - data providers, aggregators, research institutions - that we can work out how cloud technologies will create a revolution in our sector as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome expressions of interest and proposals of contribution to the project from partners in the Europeana Network and outside it. The first opportunity to discuss all these will be at the Europeana Cloud Architecture Workshop, on 28 October 2013 in the Koninlijke Bibliotheek in the Hague.

        title: 'Defining The Cloud Through Expert Forums'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"http://oldpro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=5e9d7884-e129-41ed-88bb-d331d7ccc35e&amp;groupId=1414567&amp;t=1375262870304\" style=\"height: 800px; width: 800px; float: left;\" />Europeana Cloud is working to design, create and launch a cloud-based ecosystem for Europeana and its aggregators. A key part of this work will be to determine how the cloud will serve its users, particularly those in the research community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help with this task, we will hold four Expert Forums over the course of the project, the first of which happened recently held in Dublin. It brought project partners together with researchers from the Humanities discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evaluating Possibilities</strong><br />\r\nThe goal was to establish the current possibilities for conducting research via Europeana and to make suggestions for developing future research possibilities as Europeana moves towards a cloud-based service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first half of the one-day session involved a series of exercises, beginning with a “Europeana Treasure Hunt” where teams had to register on Europeana and complete three Europeana-based challenges within 15 minutes. This allowed researchers to evaluate Europeana’s features for searching and saving results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other activities looked at the type of metadata typically provided by Europeana contributors and the ability to zero in on something very specific in the Europeana database. Often a researcher doesn’t want to manually filter through search results to find the most relevant item so this last task was to establish if easier possibilities for filtering exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://oldpro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=3da53db8-bfd6-4f60-9642-774bba0b35d4&amp;groupId=1414567&amp;t=1375262870323\" style=\"height: 800px; width: 800px; float: left;\" /><strong>Identifying Improvements</strong><br />\r\nIn the second part of the workshop, participants were asked to create case studies that illustrated how a fictional researcher might use Europeana both in its current form and in a future version with new tools and services (particularly those that could be supplied through the cloud).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the session, participants had identified several areas in which the Europeana Cloud project could improve the usefulness of Europeana for researchers. Their suggestions included:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Metadata Ranking: </strong>It was felt that few items in Europeana had sufficient metadata to make them truly useful for research. A ‘star-ranking system’ for metadata was suggested as a possible solution. Users of Europeana could rate an item for the quality of its metadata from 1 star (poor quality) up to 5 stars (excellent quality) and this would allow researchers to focus on the most useful objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multi-lingual Resources:</strong> At present, metadata can be submitted to Europeana in the native language of the contributing organisation and users must search in every language to be sure they have searched thoroughly for a particular term (eg. '<em>World War One</em>’, ‘<em>La Première Guerre Mondiale</em>’ (French), ‘<em>Pierwsza Woyna Swiatowa</em>’ (Polish), etc). The Expert Forum recommended that multilingual metadata be dynamically generated by the system as it is impractical to ask content providers to provide multi-lingual search terms, and that a thesaurus or translation tool be built that can automatically link multilingual metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Results:</strong> Better browsing functionality was unanimously recommended. Suggestions included spatial mapping and temporal mapping via maps and timelines. Simple conceptual maps, such as tag clouds or other visualisations would also be desirable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>There was overwhelming consensus that researchers from all disciplines would want to export result sets into specialised, often domain-specific tools. It was therefore strongly recommended that Europeana not develop specialised tools, but rather focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-generalised tools to aid in discovery;<br />\r\n-tools that allow for (meta)data export into a variety of formats;<br />\r\n-tools that provide more sophisticated and targeted filtering of results than are currently available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop also resulted in a number of other learning points, all of which will feed into the work of Europeana Cloud to develop better tools and services for Europeana and the research community. A complete overview of the day is available in the full <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/dbc55e39-3a31-4e6f-9306-433e8871957e\">Expert Forum report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Future Expert Forums</strong><br />\r\nThe second and third expert forums will take place towards the end of 2013 and will look specifically at tools that could be developed within Europeana Cloud for the Humanities (Expert Forum 2) and the Social Sciences (Expert Forum 3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth and final Expert Forum will be held in mid-2015. It will provide a broad review of the tools and content that can be accessed through Europeana Cloud, and develop recommendations for future work, including how the engagement of researchers will continue beyond the lifetime of the project to ensure their future use and uptake of the Europeana Research platform.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Cloud: Establishing the High Level Principles'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Blog by Maarten Zeinstra and Julia Fallon.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> is tasked with researching and developing a technological infrastructure for cloud storage of cultural heritage. The first phase of the project is intended to map what such a storage could look like. Europeana Cloud is in full flow now and has published a mission statement, a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-cloud-factsheet-final\">factsheet</a> and a set of high-level principles to guide its development and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana_cloud_establishing_the_high_level_principles.jpg\" style=\"width: 696px; height: 1000px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The mission statement</strong>: 'Europeana Cloud serves Europe’s cultural heritage institutions by delivering a more efficient solution to the current methods of storing, sharing and providing access to cultural heritage objects. It does so by providing an open source system that stores and enables services for accessing structured metadata and content. The intention is to re-use and share this material with users and participants. Europeana Cloud will be available under a sustainable business model and be governed by its users.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Principles</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission statement breaks down into the following eight principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud primarily serves Europe’s cultural heritage institutions, enabling them to provide audiences with access to their digital objects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driven by the needs of the cultural heritage industry, Europeana Cloud provides the services to enable the sharing of metadata and content for the purposes of providing access to digital objects. This delivers improved services to providers with low barriers to entry and exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud promotes openness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Openness supports re-use and sharing of cultural heritage objects as well as providing an infrastructure with low barriers for expansion and further development. Europeana Cloud produces open source software, has a preference for open standards, open file formats and promotes open content. Closed standards and closed formats can only be viewed if there is software available that can read proprietary file formats, they may prove difficult to access on future operatings systems/devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud delivers a more efficient solution to the current methods of storing, sharing and providing access to digital cultural heritage objects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud delivers efficiencies to cultural heritage providers along the lines of: a reduction of IT costs as compared with classic hosting technologies, avoiding IT infrastructure costs, enabling more time to focus on strategy and innovation, and the pooling of resources. Efficiencies are also expected in terms of saving time, speed of delivery, better integration across the Europeana Network, offering services with high availability, reliability, and security and better interoperability, easier management and greater automation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud operates under a sustainable business model</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure the long term sustainability of the services provided by Europeana Cloud, the project will operate under a sustainable business model. A variety of options will be discussed in light of EU funding availability and the need to become self-sustaining. This may allow for a reduction on the reliance of competitive funding rounds, and will encourage long-term investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud provides the infrastructure to access metadata and content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud delivers storage and services to provide secure, robust, technology neutral and sustainable access to metadata and content. These services include but are not limited to programmatic read/write access to Europeana Cloud, controlling the access to Europeana Cloud, connecting to other data services and systems and version control of data in Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud is accessible through standardised data models</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud believes interoperability is crucial for cooperation and for the use of materials in its service. Europeana Cloud makes all metadata accessible using internationally recognised standard data models. Although standards are important for re-use and interoperability, Europeana Cloud understands that source formatting is important. Europeana Cloud does not remove contributed source documents in favour of standardised models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud supports a legal framework to govern access and re-use</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud is linked to the Europeana Licensing Framework that enables the access to - and re-use of - metadata and content according to differing provider and user profiles. Each user and provider provides, makes available and re-uses metadata and content in different ways with, and for, different purposes. The legal framework ensures that these requirements are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud is a governed and led by the community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud serves the needs of its community: the providers, members and users of the services make use of and build on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/network-documents/-/document_library_display/4jQL/view/1505814\">cultural commons principles</a>. The community is self-regulating and has responsibility for establishing the boundaries of the community as well as the services provided. These services include raising awareness, offering and enabling access to resources and tools as well as ensuring Europeana Cloud is a trusted and secure resource and service for the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following period, we will fine-tune these principles to match the needs of the sector with the way the project will develop in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/84231383-421f-4af0-86f2-c8bf040558e1\">Download the High Level Principles document</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a></p>\r\n"

European cultural heritage is widely recognised as a vehicle for cultural identity and EUheritage TOUR wants to put this on a pedestal. Europeana is one of the project partners.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, <a href=\"http://www.euheritage-tour.eu/EuHeritageTour/Home.html \">EUHeritageTOUR</a> is focused on Europe's World Heritage sites, recognised by Unesco for their outstanding universal value. Since the World Heritage convention was signed in 1972, over 900 sites have been awarded this status and the majority of them are located in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of EUHeritageTOUR is the tourism potential of these World Heritage sites. On the one hand, we elaborate an attractive tourism product, on the other hand we are focusing on capacity building of stakeholders in both the cultural heritage and tourism sector. The project is specifically aimed at both young professionals and young tourists, but is obviously open to everyone interested in participating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/92244072\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/92244072\">EUheritageTOUR teaser</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/euheritagetour\">EUHeritageTOUR</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main outputs of the project:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>EUHeritageTOUR cultural route: The concept behind the EUHeritageTOUR cultural route is that ‘differences’ and ‘commonalities´ of national/ regional/ local peculiarities, represented by the UNESCO World Heritage sites throughout Europe can effectively contribute to the rise of local /inter-regional social cohesion, a stronger local and collective pride and a greater sense of European identity.</li>\r\n    <li>An e-learning course: The EUHeritageTOUR project has developed an e-learning course open to everyone - but in particular to the stakeholders in charge of managing and promoting the World Heritage sites. The contents of the e-learning course were developed on an analysis of the most interesting and innovative good practices in the field of management and promotion of the heritage sites and properties in Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This is part one of a two-part article on the EUHeritageTour project. </em></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/free-download-of-artworks/sharing-is-caring/\"><em>Sharing is Caring</em></a> is an important anthology of essays and lectures on openness and sharing in the cultural heritage sector that was published earlier this year. In light of our recent #PublicDomainMonth campaign, it brings forth many voices and arguments for leaving the public to care for our heritage, as they are the ones who sustain our institutions and keep organisations such as Europeana relevant. The public cares when cultural heritage belongs to them, is a message that echoes through the book: When cultural heritage is digitised, it can be replicated and freely shared repeatedly. We interviewed the editor of <em>Sharing is Caring</em>, <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/research/the-researchers/merete-sanderhoff/\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, curator of digital museum practice at Statens Museum for Kunst, the National Gallery of Denmark (SMK) and member of the Europeana Network, to discuss how the book came about.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/8e83292d-56b7-400e-b1e5-e10968f7ecbe.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 851px;\">\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is the aim of the book? How important is it for promoting open innovation in the cultural sector?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the book is to discuss and promote adoption of open practices in the cultural sector. It provides analyses from our peers in the sector of the implications, consequences and potential of opening up digitised collections and data, and our ways of interacting with the public. We can use the knowledge being shared, learn from it to create sustainable ways to care for our cultural heritage. A way to promote the adoption of open licensing of data and content, open practices, and an open mindset towards the world is by providing great studies, analyses, and examples from peers. Why do we want to promote this? Because sharing the authority and ability to work with, interpret, learn from and use our cultural heritage in digital form is the most sustainable way to care for it in a digital age. We need the public to care as much for the preservation of our heritage as we do, and they do that when it’s in their hands so to speak, when it’s useful to them on their own terms to do what they want and need to do; when cultural heritage is theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did the book come about? Why and how did you get involved with the book? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sharing is Caring</em> is a seminar that has been held since 2011 to put openness and sharing on the agenda in the cultural heritage sector. At SMK, we had conducted some pilot projects in close collaboration with colleague museums in Denmark to test the potentials of free image sharing, and we wanted to share and amplify what we had learned. Furthermore, we wanted to invite the thought leaders we had learned from during our pilots to bring in a broader perspective to our local community in Denmark. The seminar raised lots of interest, both from local culture and heritage communities and international peers, and we have held it ever since. After the first two years, I wanted to make sure that the great insights we gained from the speakers were captured and amplified to a wider international community. I also wanted to give back to this community something solid and valuable in return for the generous sharing of knowledge, resources and expertise that characterises the <a href=\"http://openglam.org\">OpenGLAM</a> field. That is how this anthology came about. It’s published both in Danish and English in order to reach and be useful to as many in our community as possible. It spans a wide array of topics and cases that others can refer to as best practices and lessons learned, and build on in their own work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why is open innovation important in the cultural/ memory institution sector?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content of the cultural heritage, when set free, can greatly enhance the opportunites of the creative industries, research communities, the tourism sector and so on. So open innovation is important because it’s an fantastic opportunity to let our collections, knowledge and data become an integrated part of the larger ecosystem of cognitive and creative surplus that is connected on the internet. Also, we have lots to learn from people outside of our institutions, about how the collections we take care of can be used in novel ways – by developers, startup companies, citizen scientists, crowdsourcing projects, school kids and young creatives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9bQVsa_VvE\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Michael Edson, Director of Web &amp; New Media Strategy at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., and Merete Sanderhoff, Curator of Digital Museum Practice at SMK, talk about the book</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tell us something about the contributing writers (or the organisations they represent) in relation to open innovation.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology has a wide range of contributors – from museum practitioners and experts in the cultural heritage sector to PhD students, open governance people, a lawyer and a school teacher. It includes both internationally known thought leaders and practitioners – like Michael Edson, Shelley Bernstein and Europeana’s own Jill Cousins – and then a range of people that are well known in the Danish and Scandinavian community, and whose work is leading here, and deserves to be spread to the international field. The entire GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) sector is learning on a global scale these years, and new ideas and practices spring from all over. It is not centralised, but a distributed network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Where is the book available?

The journal was born from an idea of Maria Śliwińska, chief editor of Uncommon Culture and the director of <a href=\"http://www.icimss.edu.pl/en/\">ICIMSS</a>. Uncommon Culture is a peer-reviewed journal providing unique perspectives on a rich variety of cultural activities in Europe. Examining cultural institutions and their collections, this magazine gives new insights into diverse cultural activities. Uncommon Culture deals with issues connected to digitisation of cultural heritage in Europe.1 In the frame of the <a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/index.php?en/1/home%20\">AthenaPlus project</a>, two new issues of Uncommon Culture are scheduled. The next issue of Uncommon Culture planned for October 2014 will look into the subject of digital exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has always been the task of museums, libraries and archives to build, to maintain and to research their collections as well as make them accessible to the public. Collections – both conventional and digital - are essential for understanding our past and are relevant for teaching and learning.2 Access to cultural heritage objects via a digital exhibition means that the information value is much more enhanced and enriched. Digital exhibitions can make accessible a much greater amount of objects than traditional exhibitions; they enable users to explore and research objects that may not have been accessible otherwise. Digital exhibitions can be updated constantly; they remain accessible over time and can be enhanced by the contribution of users.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1st AthenaPlus issue of Uncommon Culture will examine different aspects of digital and virtual exhibitions on a theoretical and practical level. Web services and innovative tools for creating digital exhibitions will be presented, analysed and compared; European cultural heritage institutions will report among others on their personal as well as user experiences in digital exhibitions. The <a href=\"http://museumsdokumentation.de/joomla/\">digital exhibitions</a><a href=\"http://museumsdokumentation.de/joomla/\"> working group</a> was founded in 2011 with the aim to explore current practices, searches through recent bibliography and identifies key questions in order to develop a simple set of effective guidelines for the use of memory institutions. They will also present their most recent findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to contribute an article to the first AthenaPlus issue of Uncommon Culture on the topic of digital exhibitions you are cordially invited to submit your proposal to\_<strong><a href=\"mailto:a.peukert@smb.spk-berlin.de\">a.peukert@smb.spk-berlin.de</a></strong>\_until 31 August 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Second issue of Uncommon Culture available on digital meets heritage (website) http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/available-on-line-the-second-number-of-uncommon-culture/ (04-06-2014).</div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div>Hagedorn-Saupe, Monika: Introduction, in: Uncommon Culture – Collections Development, Vol. 3, issue 5/6, Poland 2012.</div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div>Handbook on virtual exhibitions and virtual performances – version 1.0, August 2012, MIBAC and INDICATE.</div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\_</div>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p><em>By Andrew Kitchen, Incubation Coordinator, Ramulus Ltd.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/fb5ec2a3-fe16-4018-8c04-88184d592355.jpg\" style=\"width: 304px; height: 202px;\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY- SA</a> <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/home\">Europeana Creative</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prize for each Europeana Creative Challenge is a ´business incubation support package´. This blog explains what exactly it is and how it can be used by the winners to bring their product successfully to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term incubation is used in the context of business to describe a process aimed at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups to provide development and growth at an above average speed. An incubator is an organisation that provides the incubation support.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/incubation2.jpg\" style=\"width: 304px; height: 202px;\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a> <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/home\">Europeana Creative</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional business incubators do not normally provide financial support. Rather, they provide other facilities, resources and services as an alternative. This normally includes a provisional office space that is typically shared with other SMEs and start-ups, allowing for peer networking and collaborative organisational development. A range of ‘hands-on’ activities and mentoring aimed directly at taking the business to the next level (hence the incubation analogy) are normally provided in addition. Generally, incubators provide assistance for periods of greater than 1 year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also have heard the term accelerator used in a similar context. An accelerator differs from an incubator in a number of ways. Firstly, the support given to accelerate a business to market is normally provided in exchange for equity (a share of ownership) in that business. Secondly, the support is given in a more condensed or intensive manner and over a much shorter period of time than an incubator - mostly 3-4 months. Thirdly, an accelerator often provides a degree of financial support to the business it is supporting to enable its growth. Incubators and accelerators normally provide their services to SMEs and start-ups that are physically located near to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Europeana Creative project, a localised approach is not feasible as we are reaching out to a European audience. We are developing Europeana Labs as a virtual space to support a European audience and are integrating incubation support in the second half of this year. As the project is also time-bound, we have taken the most suitable aspects from both incubators and accelerators to produce our own ‘hybrid’ business incubation package that forms the prize for each Challenge winner. This package has been developed in a pragmatic manner, which embraces virtual tools and techniques, to deliver a range of traditional incubation support within the condensed timeframe of an accelerator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ecreativechallenges2014.istart.org/\">Apply to the Challenges</a> to win this prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you still have any questions drop us a message on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eCreativeEU%20\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaCreative\">Facebook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p>By Neil Bates, Marketing Specialist at Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July might be over, but we are not done talking about the public domain - not just yet. Lots of our users are taking advantage of the options available at <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana.eu</a> to search specifically for works that are in the public domain. But, which public domain works are the most popular?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(12).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 293px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09428/suub_hist_index_jsp_id_V_2_a_235_1004.html\">Map of Europe in 1860</a>.

To be honest, we just have too much to talk about and we simply cannot wait until next year. So for a little longer, keep your eyes peeled on the usual hashtag - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PublicDomainMonth?src=hash\">#PublicDomainMonth</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s blog is a fun one! It is no secret that you can discover millions of public domain works in all shapes and forms via the Europeana.eu website. During the past year on Europeana.eu, we saw that over 60,000 search queries were actively filtered using our public domain facet, and that is what we like to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here it is, our top 5 list of the most viewed public domain works on Europeana.eu from the past year, which one is your favourite?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09428/suub_hist_index_jsp_id_V_2_a_235_1004.html\">Map of Europe in 1860</a>.

        body: "<p>In the last three years, we have seen our membership grow and grow. So has the diversity of backgrounds of our members. It is this diversity along with a united passion for digital heritage that makes our community great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, we welcomed our 1,000th Europeana Network member Dr. Deveril, a cultural arts professional with a keen interest in developing new ways for people to experience cultural content. To commemorate this occasion, we decided to interview him and our first Network member Dan Mattei to see how the perception of the Europeana Network and its usefulness has evolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/5d114932-e603-4480-abbf-0f8dc4929512.jpg\" style=\"width: 247px; height: 266px;\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Dan Matei is the Director of the Movable, Digital and Intangible Heritage Department at the National Heritage Institute, Bucharest, Romania</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan Mattei has been with us since day one; he was even present in the meeting where the Europeana Network was proposed. Being in charge of a national aggregator, it was a natural decision for him to became part of the Europeana Network. The Europeana Network has been an invaluable tool for Dan to communicate with his peers, improving his insight into the mapping of metadata. Learning from the other members how to negotiate and motivate the data providers was also a key skill developed through the Network. Overall, belonging to a group of very interesting people and sharing knowledge with a community of professionals in the field have also been key rewards of his membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Deveril.jpg\" style=\"width: 247px; height: 210px;\">\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Dr. Deveril is an independent researcher and artist, currently working part-time at University of Surrey, as well as being a Think Tank Associate with Pacitti Company\_</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A dance filmmaker and site-specific performance facilitator, Deveril has been working on ideas of alternative visitor experiences. He heard about the Europeana Network during a recent collaboration in this field with the Pacitti Company and archaeologist Lucy Walker. They were working on an experimental film to ‘unlock’ objects from an Anglo-Saxon collection. He finds that being a Network member is a great way to learn of the latest thinking in digital culture and potentially connect across a range of institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he develops his own research into community arts and heritage, Deveril sees Europeana as a valuable source of information and contacts. In his view, anyone engaged in heritage work or related areas should be involved in the Network as it promotes an open and creative approach to sharing human art and culture, which Deveril believes is important in maintaining a progressive and cohesive Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p>If you regularly read the Europeana Pro blog, you have probably already heard of the open access policy of the <a href=\"http://rijksmuseum.nl\">Rijksmuseum</a> in the Netherlands. Europeana has, alongside other organisations and initiatives, worked with the museum since 2011 to make their public domain collection available online without restrictions. This has resulted <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio\">in over 150,000 high resolution images</a> for anyone to view, download, copy, remix, print and use for any purpose they can think of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum has been really satisfied with the results of this move. They believe that their core business is to get people familiar with the collection and the museum. By making the images available without copyright restrictions, their reach has extended exponentially and far beyond their own website. The material is now for example being shared and used widely in all kinds of online platforms such as Wikipedia or educational websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the decision to make everything available in the highest quality possible was not made overnight. Many small steps had to be taken to get where they are now, and a lot of both internal and external discussions were held. We believe that this case can be an inspiration for other cultural heritage institutions as well. We have therefore taken the effort to describe in a paper the entire process from the beginning to where they are now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the various steps that were taken by the museum, the paper also addresses the broader discussion on the importance of keeping cultural heritage that is out of copyright in analogue form in the public domain in digital form as well. It shows the effect on their revenue from online image sales after they started to make available the material in an open way, and the business potential of openly available cultural heritage collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming months we want to publish more case studies about cultural institutions that have opened up their collections. If you have an experience that you want to share with a wider audience, we would love to hear from you.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Galleries, libraries, museums and archives (GLAMs) can now make their digital content visible in Wikipedia articles more easily than ever before with the new <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMwiki_Toolset_Project\">GLAMwiki Toolset</a><a> built by Europeana.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several years in development, this tool gives cultural organisations the ability to mass-upload their own images, videos and sound recordings to Wikimedia Commons in the same way that they have done with other platforms like Flickr for years. For the first time GLAMs can mass-upload content without needing bespoke software, without external assistance required, with their own metadata, and at their own pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/0a339db8-6ea8-46e1-82a2-3178b1530421.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 444px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a> </a><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Piazza_di_Monte_Citorio%2C_Rome%2C_Italy-LCCN2001700966.jpg\">Piazza di Monte Citorio, Rome, Italy</a>, Library of Congress, available on Wikimedia Commons. Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once multimedia is uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, it becomes available to all 287 language editions of Wikipedia. Images, videos and sound recordings are displayed in the immediate context of encyclopedic knowledge, adding to the understanding of that content in a non-commercial and neutral space. And, being the 5th most visited website in the world means that this material can be viewed in its new educational context by a far larger audience than ever before. With the tailored attribution that the new tool provides, Wikipedia readers wanting to learn more are only two clicks away from visiting the home institution’s website. Many GLAMs already report that Wikipedia-derived traffic is one of the most important providers of inbound traffic, sharing multimedia increases that flow dramatically. You can see the <a href=\"http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/baglama2/\">image view statistics for GLAM collections on Wikipedia</a> for yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of this tool is just the beginning. In the coming months, Europeana will help to introduce its GLAM partners to their local Wikimedia community so that the newly uploaded content can begin being used to illustrate Wikipedia articles in as many languages as possible. Recently, the Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid (Dutch Institute for Sound and Vision) became the first cultural organisation to directly take advantage of this new tool, uploading <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201407/first-batch-upload-wikimedia-commons-using-gwtoolset\">500 videos from birds in the Netherlands</a>, generously donated by <a href=\"http://natuurbeelden.nl/deelnemende-organisaties\">Stichting Natuurbeelden</a> (the Foundation for Nature Footage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Spoonbill-JPG.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 341px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lepelaar_in_goud_licht_bij_zonsondergang-4961759.webm\">Lepelaar in goud licht bij zonsondergang, Natuur Digitaal (Marc Plomp); Stichting Natuurbeelden</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nl/deed.en\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within just one week, the Wikimedia community has responded to the challenge - translated titles, added appropriate categories and placed almost half of the videos in Wikipedia articles. One dedicated Wikipedian, <a href=\"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebruiker:Taketa\">Taketa</a>, has already ensured that <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lepelaar_in_goud_licht_bij_zonsondergang-4961759.webm\">this video of a Eurasian Spoonbill</a> is used to illustrate over 50 languages!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Material from several other cultural organisations from around the world have also already found their way onto Wikimedia Commons, and thereby to Wikipedia articles, thanks to the tireless efforts of the Wikimedia Community. For example <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:F%C3%A6\">Fae</a>, a volunteer Wikimedian in London, has already uploaded <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:NYPL_maps\">12,000 maps</a> from the New York Public Library, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photochrom_prints_collection\">10,000 Photocrom prints from the Library of Congress</a>, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Art_of_Japan_in_the_Rijksmuseum\">2,000 images of Japanese art from the Rijksmuseum</a> and <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Files_from_the_Historic_American_Buildings_Survey%20\">130,000 photographs from the Historical American Buildings Survey</a> (a collection planned to reach 250,000 over the the next few weeks) with this tool - all beautifully digitised by the respective GLAMs and now available to be used in Wikipedia. Many other large collections are in <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GWToolset_users\">various stages of upload</a> with more arriving all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GLAMwiki Toolset has been developed and funded in partnership with four national Wikimedia chapters (<a href=\"https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page\">UK</a>, the <a href=\"http://wikimedia.nl/\">Netherlands</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.fr/\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikimedia.ch/\">Switzerland</a>) and Europeana. Europeana works to make European culture accessible to all, and encourages the re-use of public domain digital content by researchers, educators, the creative industries and the wider public. The tool fulfills this objective by helping GLAMs to share their appropriately licensed content with Wikipedia users and disseminate valuable digital items of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a collection of digitised and freely-licensed multimedia and are interested in making it available to a global audience, <a href=\"mailto:liam.wyatt@europeana.eu\">please get in touch with us</a>. Or, if you’d like to get started directly follow the instructions on the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201407/first-batch-upload-wikimedia-commons-using-gwtoolset\">Beeld en Geluid blogpost</a>, or on the <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:GWToolset\">documentation page</a>.</p>\r\n"

Boyle is the director of the <a href=\"http://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/\">Center for the study of the Public Domain</a> at Duke Law school and author of <a href=\"http://www.thepublicdomain.org/\">The Public Domain</a>. In his lecture he explains  that ‘this is worthwhile not merely because it is the right thing to do’ but also because it ‘will yield all kinds of benefits which are very hard for us to see right now’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As custodians of our shared cultural heritage, institutions serve one of the most noble causes there is and he called on them to preach their principles louder. For Boyle, this is not only important to ensure that cultural heritage does not gets locked away by the unintended consequences of of copyright laws that were not designed for the cultural heritage 2.0, but also in order to more forcefully make the case for more funding from public and private sources. Boyle’s full lecture, and the debate that followed can now be seen online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWdalkC7Gco\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWdalkC7Gco\">Kennisland</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC-BY</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This lecture was followed by a reaction by Marjan Hammersma from the Dutch Ministry of Education Culture and Science, and a question &amp; answer session with Boyle and Hammersma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWPBKIWthT4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWPBKIWthT4\">Kennisland</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC-BY</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was hosted by <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\">Kennisland</a> and the Rijksmuseum in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/index-english.html\"> Institute for Information Law</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article was written as part of Europeana’s #PublicDomainMonth - a month dedicated to sharing knowledge, best practices and events all related to the Public Domain.

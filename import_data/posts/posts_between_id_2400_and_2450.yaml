                body: "<h3>Why is the topic of participation important to the digital cultural heritage sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions want people to participate in or be engaged with their collections - I hope and believe this. But it can be hard for institutions, because at the most fundamental level, they’re established to protect and conserve - art, archives, manuscripts, books, and so on. And, most of the 20th century wasn't about participation, it was about collecting and protecting. That’s why they invented copyright.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the 21st century is about participation, about opening up, and if what we’ve always been doing is preserving and conserving and protecting, then that can be, if not scary, then at least, challenging. Implicit in protecting is ‘against’ and implicit in participating is ‘with’. It’s 2021 and with the pandemic and climate crisis, only preserving and protecting isn’t a long-term play.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why else? We know it’s not wise right now to get on a plane and go to India to see the Taj Mahal. Right now, it’s not a good idea - for a COVID and a climate reason. We are all responsible for ourselves, for each other and for this planet, so maybe we have to respect that there are some crucially important cultural places or things that may be temporarily unavailable to us, and that’s where participating digitally comes in: it’s a complementary experience that’s available 24/7.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What activities is Europeana undertaking in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We love exploring new ways to encourage participation and that’s the topic of an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/driving-engagement-participatory-approaches-to-digital-cultural-heritage\">online conference we’re running this Thursday 2 December</a> as an accompanying event of the Slovenian Presidency. We’ll dive into how cultural institutions are addressing the sustainability of digital participation and engaging communities online with digital cultural heritage - from cool transcribathons to getting the next generation involved with our education outreach efforts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One great initiative - and it’s on the agenda for the conference as I just mentioned - is our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">transcribathon</a> initiative, which contributes to a really nice virtuous circle of improving metadata and improving participation. If we have good metadata, people can find the things they’re looking for and use it - they can participate or be engaged with it. So if we can get our audiences improving that metadata, then we insert participation itself into that virtuous circle. It then becomes a continuous cycle of encouraging people to use and interact with the material, adding value as they go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an image of a document, that’s useful to a point. But if somebody is willing to go through and look at it and type out the content, then you have so much more insight into what’s in that document and your archive becomes a lot richer. It’s more accessible and you can translate it, search it, copy it and use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge project that’s still alive and started several years ago,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/83-1914-1918\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, also had a participatory element of a user-generated content campaign. So material contributed by the public about World War One and that whole period became part of our online collection.. The idea that there’s stuff in my house that I got from my grandparents that I could add to the collective knowledge about the world, via Europeana, is really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who do you look to for best practice and inspiration in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wikipedia really changed how I think about knowledge and how we participate in sharing it. When Wikipedia formed, I was working in market research and we had proprietary tools to do the analysis of data, and it was really important to keep them proprietary. Then Wikipedia came along and it was ground-breaking. I’m not going to pretend capitalism isn’t still writ large, but some people figured out that the more we share, the stronger we are. So that’s a best practice example for me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And honestly, I learn so much by scrolling through Twitter. I’m fascinated by the analysis people do there, seemingly on the spur of the moment, it gives me so much inspiration. I think the digital world opened us up to how much wisdom there really is in people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pier-Luigi Sacco’s keynote speech at Europeana 2021 blew me away. He talked about how we’ve become more isolated, and that’s not the way forward for our species. His comments about the democratisation of digital culture were really important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How can people improve their own participation practices?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It depends on where people are on their own path of encouraging participation. So, first, it means figuring out where you are on your path and where you want to go next. And remember it’s not necessarily linear, you can go in several different directions, while still committing to learning more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where we can help is building your capacity to improve participation, starting with your digital collections. Tell us what support you need, whether that’s examples or how-to guides. Another good start is by committing to learn more at the Europeana conference this Thursday!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport Generic Services project</a> was proposed during 2019 and awarded CEF Telecom co-funding in mid 2020. Among other activities, the project planned to host a series of events across Europe, inviting members of the public to participate and share their sporting stories. Europeana's previous experience of hosting collection day events such as these has been very rewarding, with many people attending to share their personal histories, memories and reflections, and ultimately contribute to Europe’s shared cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to curtail our plans. We were unsure whether we would be able to hold the events planned under the project, or whether people would want to attend them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nonetheless, through flexibility and adaptability, this year, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/europeana-sport-collection-days\">10 in-person events</a> were able to take place in France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom. Events were held in libraries, museums, archives, online, at a sporting event, in a school and at a stadium, and when the public health situation allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Keeping in person events safe</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A priority for all the in person events was the safety of organisers and participants. At the first two in-person events held in the 'Octavian Goga' Cluj County Library in Romania, an appointment system was used to minimise the numbers of people attending at any one time. Librarian Anca Docolin says, 'Our safety preparations included plexiglass screens, masks and gloves, and disinfectant available for everyone. The event was well-received by our visitors, who brought a variety of objects about a wide range of sports.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Organisers also used a variety of locations to ensure that the events could be well managed. Instead of inviting a public audience to a venue, in September Michael Culture Association held a collection day in Polangis primary school in Joinville-Le-Pont, a suburban city 20 minutes away from Paris. Michael Culture's Marie Hartmann explains that this allowed a workflow which ensured the pupils and organisers remained safe: 'One by one, they presented their story and object, and came to a classroom for us to photograph.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Inviting the public</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it was possible and safe to invite the public to share their sporting memories at these events, the experience was rewarding for both participants and organisers. In October, the CRDI Ajuntament de Girona held an event relating to the city's rugby club history where more than 100 former players and members came together to share their memories. Organiser David Iglésias says, 'It was amazing to see how the rugby players were interested in preserving their stories. It became very clear how people value the work of archives, as a vital (and accessible) part of the city's life.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The National Archives of Hungary organised an event in Balatonfüred, alongside a popular sailing race. Senior Archivist Dorottya Szabó says, 'This event was an opportunity to bring culture and archives closer to people. With the conversations, the presentation of the archives and the collection of stories related to sports and sailing at Lake Balaton, we were able to reach out to many people. We received countless positive feedback during the event'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum combined hosting a series of events over summer 2021 with interviewing some contributors online. Senior Curator Nathan Mannion says, 'We’ve learned that there simply is no substitute for speaking directly with those who have stories and objects to share and that the interview element is critical'.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Collaboration and communities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of event organisers found that this experience helped bring Europeana closer to their communities, and showed the value of pan-European collaborative projects. The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision hosted a collection day in September at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, in collaboration with the Amsterdam Sports Council. Aisha Villegas, Outreach &amp; Communications Coordinator, says, 'The participants were enthusiastic to share their stories and reminded us of the importance of preserving the stories and memories of the community. The event was also an occasion for our institution to disseminate our and Europeana’s work, creating new connections and opening opportunities for future collaborations.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ICCU, the Europeana accredited national aggregator for Italy, collaborated with the Centro d'Arte Mediterranea to hold an event in Torre del Greco. Project coordinator Antonio Davide Madonna - a native of Torre del Greco - says, 'It was wonderful to hear the memories of people from the town. The event was popular with local politicians and organisations, demonstrating the value of Europeana to the public and citizens of Torre del Greco'.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Online &amp; hybrid</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some partners opted for hybrid events, with the National Library of Scotland organising virtual and in-person workshops. These are being held in collaboration with Scottish sporting organisations which work with under-represented groups: LEAP Sports Scotland (which promote LGBTQ+ sport participation), Scottish Disability Sport, Scottish Ethnic Minority Sports Association (SEMSA) and Street Soccer Scotland. Graeme Hawley, Head of General Collections at National Library of Scotland, says 'This approach allows us to collaborate to improve the diversity of the stories shared with the Europeana Sport project.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Storytelling and more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ad Pollé, Europeana’s Senior User Generated Content Projects Coordinator, says, 'In challenging circumstances, it's great to see all that the Europeana Sport partners have achieved through their collaborations. Sport heritage is an often overlooked part of cultural heritage. The events - and all the people who participated in them - have resulted in a wonderful series of events and stories that reflect diverse sporting heritage from all across Europe.' <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=europeana_collectionName%3A%28256_Sports_UGC%29\">Read the stories.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are a cultural heritage institution interested in organising an event to engage the public with your sporting collections you can find out more on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-sport#collection-campaigns-online\">Europeana Sport page</a> or contact me (adrian.murphy@europeana.eu).</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Putting values at the heart of Europe's digital future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first day of the conference opened with an address from Commissioner Thierry Breton, who introduced the European data space for cultural heritage, underlining the role of Europeana and its vibrant community in establishing such a digital space. Keynote speeches from <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/towards-a-common-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">Yvo Volman</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/coming-of-age-in-the-digital-decade\">George Oates</a> further deepened our understanding, highlighting the importance of democratic access to digital public spaces and exploring how we can preserve and protect them. Following this inspiring morning, afternoon sessions looked at topics including Open Glam, cultural heritage hackathons, the role of digital cultural heritage in education and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ensuring sustainable digital transformation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Day two of Europeana 2021 was dedicated to sustainable digital transformation, opening with a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/call-to-action-for-a-more-sustainable-inclusive-and-beautiful-europe\">compelling speech from Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović</a>, Secretary General of Europa Nostra. Her address emphasised the importance of cultural heritage in shaping a sustainable and beautiful future. The Europeana Initiative was excited to follow up on the address by launching a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Climate Action Manifesto</a>, a commitment to minimising the digital cultural heritage sector’s impact on the climate and environment. After this exciting morning, afternoon sessions explored preserving heritage, greening cultural heritage institutions, creating impact, enabling diversity and inclusion, using immersive technologies and much more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using technology to drive social change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final day of Europeana 2021 looked at how the sector could use technology as a tool for social change. A topical, thought-provoking and insightful <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/cultural-participation-digital-technologies-and-transformational-social-change\">keynote from Professor Pier Luigi Sacco</a> opened the day, exploring cultural participation in the digital world, and how to make it inclusive, democratic and collective. The talk further enriched our understanding of participation, which was supported in later sessions on extended reality, artificial intelligence, digital storytelling, crowdsourcing and using digital cultural heritage to raise awareness of the climate emergency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Social activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 also provided plenty of opportunities for participants to relax, network and have fun. Gather.Town provided an informal digital space to make new connections and we were happy to include a dedicated space and lunch event for new professionals and those attending their first conference. Participants were also able to have fun with a pub quiz, mindful origami sessions and a #DigitalAperitivo. This online event, organised by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Community</a>, encouraged participants to come together and share the culture they love on social media, in multiple languages. You can still explore all the wonderful cultural heritage shared through the Aperitivo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalAperitivo?src=hashtag_click\">on Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rewatch the keynotes and panel sessions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a conference as rich as Europeana 2021, it was hard to follow all of the action, so we are delighted to share the recordings of the keynotes and all the panel sessions, which are available on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">conference page</a>. For each session you can find some information about what the session covered, who the expert speakers are, view any related presentations and of course re-watch the sessions themselves.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Why is the topic of diversity and inclusion important to the digital cultural heritage sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Julia: Cultural heritage should represent who we are, and it should be accessible and relatable to everybody. Cultural heritage has a role to play in social cohesion and helping to connect and shape identities but there are a large number of people or experiences that aren't represented, and aren't shown or talked about in our cultural heritage. So that’s the first element for us right now - helping make sure everyone is represented by and can learn from our cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second element is making sure that everyone can access that cultural heritage online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We need to make sure that technology actually helps enhance the accessibility of our heritage and that we use the opportunities that digital transformation provides to make sure that we can better represent everybody and all different parts of societies and communities, whether they're local, or remote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nWhat activities is Europeana undertaking in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we have a team dedicated to looking at improving our practices. They are developing a community pact to help us set a standard for online engagement as well as&nbsp; a programme of learning and teaching designed to help staff become more confident in talking about genuine diversity and inclusivity in our work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking about the more technical elements of what we do, we are improving accessibility on our websites, for example, by implementing alt text (textual descriptions) on images, and we’re looking to understand how emerging technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) or machine learning can help us improve our data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we’re also working really hard on the editorial we share, to&nbsp; improve diversity and inclusivity there. On Europeana Pro, we ran a series on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=women+in+culture\">women working with AI</a> as part of Women’s History Month. And our recent <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/black-lives-in-europe\">Black Lives in Europe exhibition</a>&nbsp;went through an external sensitivity review to make sure it was respectful, and was then translated into six languages.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course we want to do even more. So we are working with our communities to help us to think through what else we need to do. We’re taking steps to be more open and inclusive to professionals who are new to the sector, who are keen to learn and engage, and have different needs to more experienced professionals. And for events, we now always ask people what accessibility or participation needs they have so that we can strive to meet them. In our Europeana 2021 conference, for example, we provided live transcription, helping more people to participate on the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who do you look to for best practice and inspiration in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well firstly I’m a white woman talking about diversity and inclusivity being important, so I have to ask myself what can I learn from my position of privilege so that I can do more?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I strongly believe that we learn through our networks - the power of the people helps you to learn on a personal level and bring that into your organisation and into your work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work that Europa Nostra did with the European Association for Students during the European Year of Cultural Heritage was great. They set up a programme and a partnership with regional communities for new professionals, separate from their <a href=\"http://www.esach.org/\">Ambassador programmes</a>. That project has a longevity to it, placing new professionals in a career path in cultural heritage, which I find inspirational.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A community I follow on Twitter called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julia_fallon/status/1415262627262042112?s=20\">Cilip LGBTQ</a> had an awareness day which asked ‘How do you respect trans people in your workplace?’ and gave some great tips. I discussed this with my team, and from that, started both noticing and seeing others more comfortable sharing their pronouns, for example. It's something I hadn’t thought about as relevant to me before but that resource came up on my social media timeline and I thought it was great.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These kinds of conversations are increasing across our Europeana networks. The Europeana Aggregators' Forum recently ran a moderated discussion around what diversity and inclusivity means and about how they can develop vocabularies across their own aggregation systems. While in another meeting recently, the facilitator introduced herself and described what she was wearing for the audio recording. We can learn from these examples and each contribute to being more diverse and inclusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How can people get involved?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining the Europeana Network Association is a really great way to start. We don’t have a community specifically dedicated to diversity and inclusivity but we have a growth mindset and a commitment to making all of our activities more diverse and inclusive. If you are interested in copyright, you could join our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Europeana Copyright community</a> and have an impact on how we use copyrights to better label cultural heritage that comes from indigenous communities, for example. Or you could contribute towards our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech community</a> and join discussions around AI and the&nbsp; diversity of data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Your roles all involve working with people or organisations outside of the Europeana Foundation - what specific elements of collaboration are you focused on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Milena Popova (Programme &amp; Business Development Manager)</strong>: My role is about partnerships and projects, mainly focusing on projects. What is typical is that we work with a wide range of different types of partners, from non-profits&nbsp; to corporate, and both big and small organisations to prepare proposals for EU-funded project calls. And if and when they’re funded, we work together to make them a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Eleanor Kenny (Head of Communications and External Relations)</strong>: I promote and foster stakeholder relationships at an EU or pan-European level, for example with the European Parliament, at the European Heritage Alliance, or on the European Commission’s Cultural Heritage Expert Group. It’s important to share the successes and challenges of digital heritage, and to learn from others about what is important in their areas, to see where we can work together for shared goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-90130402-7fff-0976-472e-2dd44a82d032\">Julia Fallon (Community and Partner Engagement Manager): </b>My role is in bringing professionals together in the Europeana Network Association and across the sector. The focus is on the individuals not the organisations, so that people can share knowledge, learn from each other and create new opportunities together.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why is your area of collaboration important to the digital cultural heritage sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Milena</strong>: Funded projects provide an excellent opportunity for organisations from the sector to progress with their digital transformation. Whether they’re short-term and practical (Generic Services projects) or more experimental and longer term (Horizon 2020/Horizon Europe), they bring together work on improving data quality, engaging with audiences, and implementing new innovative technology, to improve the sector both now and for the future.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Eleanor</strong>: For me, it’s that Europeana has got such a great story to share about the role of digital cultural heritage in society. Most of the organisations that I deal with are very invested in cultural heritage but they may not be so aware of the digital aspects of it, or they are aware but they need more help to support or promote it effectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-5f2d3930-7fff-3e4a-3230-9afd04bc45ea\">Julia:</b> It’s about achieving impact at scale, bringing professionals together to share knowledge. They can then share back what they’ve learnt with their own networks and that ripple can continue in ways that wouldn’t be possible without a knowledge-sharing network like the ENA. In cultural heritage, capacity building activities can be difficult to find or fund,&nbsp;but by getting together, we can look at where our common ground is and that can really bring the sector together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nWhat activities is Europeana undertaking in your area of collaboration? What are you excited by?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Milena</strong>: The Europeana Foundation collaborates with over 80 organisations in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-projects\">12 Generic Services projects</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/indices\">InDICEs</a> Horizon 2020 project and we’re joint partners in five project proposals for the first round of Horizon Europe calls. The calls’ topics - green tech, new ways of participatory management and enhancing cultural heritage with advanced digital technologies - are really exciting and I hope that our applications will be successful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Eleanor</strong>: I’m excited about the potential for our sector and for digital cultural heritage to contribute to the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a> initiative. It asks how do we live more sustainably together and how do we respond to that challenge together? What’s exciting is that the New European Bauhaus wants to put culture alongside technology to help solve those problems - together we can help it do that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a92bc1da-7fff-74b7-c663-fc875991d259\">Julia: </b>We recently ran a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a> and one thing it identified was the need for the ENA to address topics relevant to newer professionals in our sector, whether that’s climate action or social responsibility, for example. We’re hoping that through our new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community\">Climate Action community</a>, we can reach new professional audiences. Most ENA members are members of more than one of our specialist communities, so bringing someone into the Climate Action community means they’re likely to step into another community, and if they’re a new professional, you’re supporting that growth path. These are opportunities that people didn’t have 10 or 15 years ago.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who do you look to for best practice and inspiration in this area?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Milena</strong>: I find the project collaboration a true source of inspiration and learning. Partners bring different perspectives, share interesting ideas and we develop best practices together. All the projects are exciting but I really like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/j-ark-european-jewish-community-archive\">J-Ark - European Jewish Community Archive</a>. It’s the first project to connect the three digital service infrastructures - Europeana, eTranslation and eArchiving - so it can really support the sector.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Eleanor</strong>: I get the most inspiration when we’re actually collaborating with other people, for instance, with Europa Nostra on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europe-day-manifesto-cultural-heritage-a-powerful-catalyst-for-the-future-of-europe\">European Heritage Alliance manifesto</a>. At a moment of crisis due to the pandemic, the sector came together and we worked with like-minded partners in the cultural heritage sector to make a strong case for the importance of the sector at that time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4b1a05ca-7fff-b046-5110-65827dad30a1\">Julia: </b>The pandemic has shown that there are some incredibly good ways to collaborate out there in the cultural heritage sector - museums chatting on social media, or engaging with audiences online. There’s been a proliferation of webinars on demand, and people getting together online to share experiences. Our sector is really creative and the pandemic has given the opportunity to make that more visible to even more audiences. We can learn from each other in many different ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nHow can people get involved or develop their own collaboration practices?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Milena</strong>: I would be thrilled to hear from people who would like to explore new partnership opportunities. So please <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/milena-popova\">get in touch</a> if you have an idea for a project proposal under the forthcoming EU funding calls. You can also check out our current activity on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/projects\">Projects</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/partnerships\">Partnerships</a> pages on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eleanor</strong>: The European Commission has recently run important consultations to shape the future of digital cultural heritage. They covered programmes, projects and funding, as well as ideas and values. We promoted our responses to these consultations and the sector responded strongly, raising its voice to say what was important. So, participating in these consultations is one way that organisations and professionals can collectively make a difference to the wider conversation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b572ffdb-7fff-ef95-a7fb-8e02cfd1229a\">Julia:</b> You can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">join the Europeana Network Association</a>!

It brings together people of different backgrounds, ages and&nbsp;skills with a shared passion for culture, creativity and fun. This year, we invited former participants and winners to tell us what inspires and motivates them. They shared the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/how-to-make-a-great-gif\">‘behind the scenes’</a> of their work - from finding material and curating galleries on Europeana to creating animation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>GIF-making Academy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GIF IT UP us for everyone - that’s why the curation of selected open material and tutorials helping beginners and first-time GIF-makers have always been an integral part of the competition. This year, we experimented with a new format: The GIF-making Academy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis three-part email course offered an opportunity to receive all the information and resources directly into your mailbox. The Academy is still open and it’s possible to join at any time&nbsp;and follow the course at your own pace. We’ll be updating and improving it throughout the year. Curious? <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hJKufP\">Join</a> over 380 subscribers!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Animating sport</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last few months, we have shared a lot of interesting stories about sporting heritage as part of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport</a>. In the last year, a lot of real-life sporting events have been cancelled or held without the public, so&nbsp;we thought it would be nice to combine sport, cultural heritage and creativity in a special prize category for GIF IT UP - and vintage pictures of athletes and competitions seemed like perfect material for remixing. We also hope that created GIFs will help make the link between sports, culture and community more visible within digital space. You can explore these GIFs and more on <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifitup\">Giphy</a>.</p>\r\n"

For a few years, a group of high school students from Liepaja, Latvia have surprised us with their sense of humour, creativity and excellent submissions. This year another group from a school&nbsp;in Italy impressed us with their submissions related to the topic of waves which they explored at school. We love to see younger generations learning things through GIFs while having fun, as well as getting a chance to win prizes in the special children and teens category.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More open collections, more fun</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the Art Institute of Chicago joined the competition as a content partner with a selection of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?style_ids=Impressionism&amp;is_public_domain=1&amp;utm_source=GIFITUP&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gif_contest&amp;utm_term=impressionism\">impressionist artworks</a> in the public domain. The new material has been warmly received by the participants, resulting in 34 animated GIFs made by creators from across the globe. This brings a truly global dimension to GIF IT UP, with partners in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>A new way to explore cultural heritage&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana website offers people multiple ways to explore the cultural heritage content shared by institutions throughout Europe online - from inspiring editorial (blogs, galleries and exhibitions) to entity pages which bring together content on a particular topic, figure or time period. With the creation of dedicated ‘Organisation pages’ on the website, audiences are now able to browse and discover content by the specific organisation which shared the data with Europeana. The organisations can be browsed through an alphabetical <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/organisations\">list on the website</a> or found via the main search by typing the name of a specific organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The list currently contains 2,241organisations identified by Europeana, linking to <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />56,270,479 items. These organisations are the cultural heritage institutions and aggregators who have contributed data to Europeana, or in some cases the projects which supported the data publication activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Promoting collections and institutions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to offering a new way of browsing content, the development of the organisation pages means that institutions who share data with Europeana each have their own, dedicated page showcasing the content they provided. These new pages highlight the institutions who provide data to Europeana more prominently, and will allow us to promote their collections. The pages can also be used by cultural heritage institutions to develop, support and affirm their digital presence on the Web, and showcase the efforts they have undertaken to digitise and share their collections with Europeana.</p>\r\n"

We will undertake many improvements over the next few months to curate the underlying data and to improve the experience of this new feature for audiences and cultural heritage institutions alike. We will make each organisation's individual page more user friendly and improve its navigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of Europeana’s objectives is to improve users' multilingual experience of the Europeana website and the data it offers access to. In this first iteration, the names of the organisations are displayed in English where available in order to make it more widely accessible to our international audience. English is used by Europeana as part of its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-multilingual-strategy\">multilingual strategy</a> as, a ‘bridge for translating all other languages to and from’, and in coming iterations organisation names will be displayed in their original language (using sometimes different alphabets) next to their English version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Give us feedback</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If you have published data in Europeana, you can help us to ensure that all organisations are well represented in the Europeana website. Your feedback is essential - to indicate problems or errors, or make suggestions for improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are aware of instances where a cultural heritage institution that has published data in Europeana does not yet have an organisation page, or alternatively, of pages where the quality of the descriptive information varies (for instance wrong names or translations). If you share data with Europeana, please use the user feedback button on the Europeana website&nbsp;(a small, blue round icon which appears on the lower right hand side of the screen)&nbsp;to tell us anything you see that is odd, wrong, or not clear when you look at the organisation pages. Your feedback will help us improve these pages and bring benefits to the cultural heritage institutions who share their data with us - and the audiences who enjoy them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

However, if you want to screen a YouTube video for educational purposes (for example, to prompt a discussion with your students on certain topics), this is likely to be allowed by copyright exceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some videos on YouTube are distributed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons licences</a>, meaning that anyone can reuse them under certain conditions. Another great source of audiovisual content that can be used in the classroom is <a href=\"https://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a>, which offers free online access to thousands of items of audiovisual heritage covering landmark events from the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When and how should I credit the author/source of audiovisual media? Can you give me some examples?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is always good practice to credit the author and source of the audiovisual content you use for educational purposes. It is often also legally required;&nbsp;in addition to economic rights, in most jurisdictions authors hold moral rights such as the right of attribution, that is the right to be identified as the author of the work.&nbsp;Certain copyright exceptions explicitly require acknowledgement of the authors. All Creative Commons licences also require attribution. So whether you are using an audiovisual work with permission from the copyright owner (for example, under a CC or other licence), under a copyright exception or because copyright in the work has expired, it is always advisable to credit the authors of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When using Europeana items, credits should include the title of the work and its authors, the date of creation, the source (institution and country providing the item) and type of licence or copyright status (e.g. Public Domain). You can see an example of how this could work in practice below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The Europeana website has a new functionality that helps you do just that. When you download an item from the Europeana website, you will automatically get a message providing the relevant information to include in the credits. You can also find usage guidelines for metadata <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/rights/usage-guidelines-for-metadata\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are copyright exceptions? Is copyright forever?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Copyright does not last forever. In most EU countries, copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the author (or of the last surviving author in the case of a work of joint authorship). After that, the works of the author enter the public domain and everyone can use them for free. As they rely on more recent technological developments, most films and television programmes from the 20th century are still protected by copyright. However, some great old films such as those by <a href=\"https://archive.org/search.php?query=director%3A%22Georges+M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s%22\">Georges Méliès</a> are in the public domain in many jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Copyright exceptions are cases in which under certain circumstances one can use copyright protected works without permission from the copyright owner. These uses are permitted by law because they are considered to be socially, culturally, politically or economically beneficial. Education is one of them. However, as with the public domain, copyright exceptions are territorial and vary from country to country. You can check which copyright exceptions apply in your country using the interactive map <a href=\"https://copyrightexceptions.eu/\">CopyrightExceptions.eu</a>, developed by Kennisland and currently being updated by <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/\">COMMUNIA</a>. The Horizon 2020 consortium <a href=\"https://www.recreating.eu/\">ReCreating Europe</a> is also working with COMMUNIA to map copyright exceptions in the EU, and is currently developing the EU version of the <a href=\"https://www.copyrightuser.org/\">CopyrightUser.org website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where can I find open source materials I can use without having to worry about copyright?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections\">Europeana </a>website is a great starting point. It gives you access to millions of books, music, artworks and more, clarifying the copyright status of each item with rights statements and Creative Commons marks.&nbsp;On <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a> you can also find many educational resources and learning scenarios that use digital culture freely available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other sources of free to use materials include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>: a collection of over 75 million images, sound and videos that are freely usable under Creative Commons and other open licences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikibooks</a>: a collection of thousands of open-content textbooks that anyone can edit.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/\">Pixabay</a>: offer many images that are free to use under Creative Commons or other open licences.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/prelinger\">Prelinger Archives</a>: a collection of over 60,000 films (mostly 'ephemeral') that are in the public domain in the US.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://incompetech.com/music/\">Incompetech</a>: royalty-free music recorded by Kevin MacLeod.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html\">NASA content</a>: works produced by the US federal government are generally not protected by copyright.

We work with the world’s leading content providers—such as Europeana—to get records for high-quality content into WorldCat®&nbsp;and OCLC’s library services. Today, we work with more than 400 partners, providing millions of fully or hybrid peer-reviewed open-access materials, including books, journals, research papers, open educational resources (OERs) and other materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you want to bring content from Europeana to the platform?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html\">OCLC</a> shares Europeana’s goal to make open content resources visible and accessible for all, and there was clear demand for Europeana content from our users and the library community.

Users of WorldCat.org and other OCLC discovery services can search WorldCat to find and access millions of popular and unique items, including the newly added collections from Europeana. An open access filter allows people to search only resources that are openly licensed and immediately available for use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The content you have integrated from Europeana is all open access. What does OCLC see as the value of openly licensed content?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Libraries are increasingly managing and relying on open content as part of their overall collection strategy. This is helping to alleviate strains on already tight budgets. And this is only a part of the story: in Europe, Australia, Canada and other regions of the world, open government and open science policies and mandates are driving openly licensed content. Open access to scientific outputs is becoming the norm in increasing numbers of countries. The digitisation of cultural heritage collections at scale, together with tackling the rights clearance issues that come with online publishing and reuse of the digitised materials, has also produced enormous amounts of open content. The inclusion of this open content in WorldCat increases discovery and access to these valuable materials and eliminates barriers for people looking for information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This has been especially important since&nbsp;the pandemic, when researchers, teachers and students need immediate access to relevant and available online resources. The pandemic also exposed the high cost of licensed materials and so libraries had to prioritise free and/or open alternatives. It boosted the digitisation-on-demand of physical resources. Open content is here to stay, and OCLC is committed to supporting libraries in facilitating access to this content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adding more than 25 million openly licensed records from the Europeana website to WorldCat means expanding the reach and impact of these valuable resources to help promote knowledge sharing, learning and creativity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can you tell us about the process of integrating the content from Europeana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana staff partnered with our metadata experts to ensure the best possible access to Europeana resources through WorldCat Discovery. This will allow libraries and their users from around the globe to discover the rich, open content offered through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We used the Europeana OAI-PMH API to harvest and download the Europeana metadata.&nbsp; We encountered no challenges using this API, and look forward to exploring other opportunities with the existing APIs offered by Europeana in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have plans to further develop your partnership with Europeana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are always looking to further expand our partnerships with content providers and for ways to help libraries automate the data workflow.&nbsp;We are definitely interested in discussing ways we can expand our partnership with Europeana to make even more knowledge and information discoverable and accessible by libraries worldwide.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Can you tell us a bit about your roles with the Europeana Foundation? &nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: In 2007, I was chairing the Conference of National Librarians, which had a platform called The European Library. The European Commission asked us if we would be willing to use it as a test platform and develop Europeana. So I grew into being the first chair of Europeana. In 2011, I stepped back because I believe in change and was asked four years ago if I’d be the chair again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: Everyone was extremely happy that you were willing to! I first walked into the Foundation without much knowledge about it at all. When we set up the Europeana Network Association, I was on its Management Board for four years. Then I became Vice-Chair of the Europeana Foundation because I had specialised in finance and governance issues. So my role evolved from that of an outsider to a userful pillar for the Foundation. With Elisabeth as chair, it was a fantastic journey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why is Europeana special to you?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: Europeana gave me the opportunity to combine my passion about Europe with my profession as a librarian. I believe in culture as the most important element that keeps us Europeans together, more than the Euro or finance and trade. But to convince people in their hearts, it’s culture and history - always.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: One of the things that is difficult in cultural heritage is that access is not very democratic. Cultural heritage institutions can be very expensive for the public to access and if you look at collections, they were not created democratically. I want people to enjoy cultural heritage without having to pay, and in particular, to increase its opportunities for use in education. Europeana is an important platform in that process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Can you tell us about a particular highlight from your time with the Europeana Foundation?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: I was fortunate to be there when Europeana launched for the first time in Brussels. We held a ceremony for the Commissioner and a huge and very important crowd. Then - as we all know - the server broke down because so many people clicked and wanted to search and it was all over the media the next day - <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_08_733\">huge success, server went down</a>. That was exciting. It was a case study of how to work together&nbsp; with high politicians and with the media. It’s one of the highlights of my whole career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also very proud to be asked to be on the Comité des Sages expert group because of my role with Europeana. With the Commission, we developed <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/79a38a23-e7d9-4452-b9b0-1f84502e68c5\">recommendations</a> that were published and handed over to politicians in a very high profile ceremony. The recommendations are still quoted even though it was some time ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: When I first came into Europeana, I didn’t understand what was going on - the abbreviations, who the people were. I felt totally inadequate. But I found my feet when I realised I had a good understanding of the structural elements of the organisation. I then started to look at the Foundation’s statutes and goals and how to make it more democratic. So I’m proud that although initially I felt I had no role to play, I can look back at bringing all these interesting people together to develop a really good working structure. I think that’s very satisfying.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What do you think the greatest challenges facing Europeana and digital cultural heritage are right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: How to measure success. If you want to get funding or cooperation, it is important to show your success. At the beginning, it was relatively easy, it was the quantity of metadata from digital items. That soon developed into use rates. Now it’s reuse. I sympathise with that idea but what is the benchmark for that? If it is not numbers, what kind of stories are accepted as success? We continuously have to find new answers to prove success. That’s a real challenge because we need to satisfy those who give the money and those who work with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: For me, it’s to do with the collections themselves. Europe has wonderful digital collections but the quality is not always very good, nor is it diverse - it’s heavily on the western European side - and that’s not on Europeana, that’s down to the digitisation done by the different Member States. But countries now have to pay the bill for all the COVID-19 measures they have taken and for countries with small budgets, digitisation might become a luxury again so I fear that the imbalance in collections might get even bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the biggest positive changes you’ve seen in digital cultural heritage during your time with the Europeana Foundation?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: Working together across domains has become something that is normal, at least in digital. People have learned that you can’t just stay within your community, your comfort zone, you have to reach out to work together with all the others even though they have different traditions, like in technical formats, cataloguing rules or professional education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a long discussion about whether it’s good or bad to put something online for free, especially for museums who often need to generate income from onsite visits. Now it seems to be a common view that you attract more users, customers and visitors if you have a wonderful internet presence and you share things and people find you on all kinds of platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright was very important from the beginning, we did a huge campaign for free access for things that are out-of-copyright. The open access drive for copyright-free material, and the sharing among institutions and across the borders of a domain are real improvements and Europeana has a huge share in that development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: For me, it’s that with COVID-19, the sense that digitisation is an expensive luxury disappeared. People started to understand how important it is to have all of this digitisation in place - the world changed and this was vital, it was one of the only opportunities to enjoy cultural heritage. This showed us all of a sudden why Europeana is there. It hasn’t always been easy to convince people that digitising cultural heritage was important, but now people see how indispensable it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is your wish for the sector for the next few years?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: First, I’ve long been worried that if cultural heritage is defined by copyright rules, then our history from the last 70 years - and in most cases many more - cannot be shown&nbsp;digitally without prohibitively time-consuming rights clearance procedures. That’s much too long. So I would like to see the national implementations of the Out-of-Commerce-works articles in the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market so that artifacts that&nbsp; are no longer in commercial use can easily be made open and freely available on public, not-for-profit cultural platforms like Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, I’d like to see faster development in the implementation of automated translation and artificial intelligence. With the right technology, we can link metadata and combine everything that’s held on a person, topic or place, in any language so we can see it all together. I’ve been hoping for automatic translation and classification and subject indexing for my whole librarian’s career and that’s a long time. I would really love a breakthrough and a big success in that field for us in the cultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joke</strong>: My first wish is that the Foundation develops itself as the innovation instrument of the cultural heritage arena and all those who want to use it. The Commission has specific technical requests and policies, for instance to do with 3D, while the sector might be talking about the influence of climate change or inclusion. The Europeana Foundation as an organisation is forward-looking and has insights into both the near and further future. I think it’s important that the Foundation finds its own clear position and creates its own very strong identity, delivering both what the Commission and the sector need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second wish is for education. We’ve been talking about digitisation in education since the early ‘90s. If I compare the opportunities available through Europeana with what’s actually being used, I see a big gap. I hope the education community will continue to explore what can be done here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Martina and thank Elisabeth for her exemplary service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Welcome to Martina Bagnoli</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/martina-bagnoli\">Martina Bagnoli </a>was elected by the Europeana Foundation’s Supervisory Board. She has been Executive Director of the <a href=\"https://gallerie-estensi.beniculturali.it/\">Gallerie Estensi</a>&nbsp;since 2015. Martina will lead the Europeana Foundation as an important new chapter opens up for the role of digital cultural heritage, reflecting the European Commission’s ambitions for a Digital Decade that promotes an open, democratic and sustainable society. We are pleased to welcome Martina and look forward to working with her to strengthen recognition of the role that access to digital cultural heritage plays in contributing to a fairer, more inclusive and sustainable society, as well as highlighting the infrastructure that needs to be in place to ensure that contribution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martina Bagnoli says,&nbsp;‘The power of cultural heritage to tell stories, to change perspectives, and to foster understanding is already known. Democratising access to cultural heritage by making it available and accessible online is an important endeavour, encouraging knowledge-sharing, creativity and innovation. I look forward to working with Europeana to foster the conditions needed to advance digital cultural heritage, strengthening its impact by making it participatory, and to help Europeana to thrive.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thank you to outgoing chair, Elisabeth Niggemann</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Martina Bagnoli succeeds <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/elisabeth-niggemann\">Elisabeth Niggemann</a>. Elisabeth has now served two terms as Chair of the Europeana Foundation. She served as Europeana’s first Chair between 2007 and 2011, launching and consolidating Europeana. Elisabeth was then re-elected Chair in 2017 at an important moment in the development of Europeana as it moved to &nbsp;a new funding mechanism under the previous European Commission’s multi-annual financial framework. Her contribution to the Europeana Foundation has been immeasurable. Under Elisabeth’s tenure, the Europeana Foundation played a key role in placing digital at the heart of the European Year of Cultural Heritage and has continued to serve the heritage sector throughout the challenges of the pandemic. We thank her for her tireless leadership and unwavering commitment. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Further changes to the Supervisory Board</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Current board member <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/taja_vovk_van_gaal\">Taja Vovk van Gaal</a> will take up the role of Vice-Chair on the departure of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/joke_van_der_leeuw_roord\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joke’s contribution as Vice-Chair to the Europeana Foundation has been invaluable over the past nine years, particularly in developing the areas of education, finance, and representation. Joke has been the architect of several key changes in the governance structure of Europeana Foundation and the Europeana Network Association, of which she was the founding member. We thank Joke for her commitment and for generously sharing her expertise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/Wim_Nieuwenhuijse\">Wim Nieuwenhuijse</a> of Tack Digital has been elected to the Europeana Foundation Board as a general Supervisory Board member and will formally join the Board in February 2022. Wim brings particular expertise in the areas of digital transformation, strategy and finances to the Board. We look forward to working with him.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In 2021 the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> (the body of formally elected representatives of the ENA) met virtually three times. In March, the Council approved the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/Governance_documents/ENA-strategic-priorities-in-2021.pdf\">strategic priorities for ENA in 2021-2022</a>, representing a long term vision for ENA. These include cross-initiative capacity building and digital transformation; cross-initiative inclusion and diversity; transparency, accountability and democracy; harnessing the potential of ENA members; and ENA mechanisms and funding. Councillors began diving into each of these topics and looking at how they could be taken forward, working together at a number of key meetings over the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Supporting digital transformation and capacity building</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital transformation remained a key focus in all of this year’s Council meetings. Working closely with the Europeana Initiative on behalf of the network, in the spring Council members contributed to co-creating a framework aiming to empower, motivate and guide the sector’s capacity building. At their second meeting, Councillors discussed developing ENA’s vision for Digital Public Space for Culture by 2030 and contributing to capacity building work across the Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were delighted to support a Europeana Initiative <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/digital-transformation-task-force\">Capacity Building Task Force</a> which kicked off in September and aims to develop a vision of what digital transformation looks like in the sector in all its different facets, and begin to plan out how to support, enable and measure it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Work on diversity and inclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Identified as a key topic of interest for the ENA in 2021, this year the Council continued discussing diversity and inclusion in the network and the sector. The Council formed an Anti-racism group, and Councillors began working with external consultants to gain a better understanding of inclusion and diversity. The delivery of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a> final recommendations, which identified key challenges facing new professionals in the ENA and the cultural heritage sector, contributed significantly to this effort. The Council also formally established the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ena-membership-working-group\">Membership Working Group</a> which aims to make the ENA more open, inclusive and diverse, and provide more opportunities for young, new and emerging professionals to get involved with the ENA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout June, several Councillors took part in a series of workshops which provided tools to help Europeana develop a shared value system in the form of a common Europeana Initiative Community Pact. In the months to come, representatives of the Foundation, ENA and the Aggregators’ Forum will together take part in the Europeana Initiative Diversity and Inclusion Task Force which will define a strategy to enable the Europeana vision for a diverse and inclusive cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community work&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March, the Council revised the original <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/ENA-Community-Terms-of-Reference-2021.pdf\">Community Terms of Reference</a>. During the first two Council meetings of the year, a space was created for the Community Steering Groups to compare their current work plans and to see how they can support each other. They discussed things they could work on together this year, and briefly touched upon where they see their communities in three years from now. At the December Council meeting, Communities presented their work plans for 2022 and invited the Council to give feedback.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Climate action: birth of a new community&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At their summer meeting on 30 June, the Council approved the proposal to formalise the status of the former ENA Climate Action Group with an aim to raise awareness and to take responsibility for collective climate action. The ENA, Europeana Foundation and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum agreed to take this issue forward as a shared priority, and this resulted in the creation of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Europeana Climate Action Manifesto</a>, launched at Europeana 2021, and the new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community\">ENA Climate Action Community</a>, launched at the ENA General Assembly meeting in November 2021. We are delighted to welcome the Europeana Climate Action Community, and see this as a major achievement for ENA this year!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA General Assembly event</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 3 November 2020, around 120 ENA members and Councillors gathered virtually at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/AGM/General-Assembly-2021-Digital-Programme-Public.pdf\">ENA General Assembly</a>. The audience had an opportunity to learn more about the governance of ENA and the six existing Communities, their task forces and future plans. The members approved the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2021/Europeana-Network-Association-Annual-report-2021.pdf\">ENA Annual Report 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2021/Europeana-Network-Association-Financial-Report-2020.pdf\">Financial Report 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2021/Europeana-Network-Association-Budget-2022.pdf\">Provisional Budget for 2022</a> and reflected on the ENA’s achievements over the year. They also looked at the goals and aspirations for ENA in the coming year, which you can read about in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2021/Europeana-Network-Association-Activity-Plan-2022.pdf\">Activity Plan for 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the highlights was a panel discussion dedicated to engineering the Network and engaging ENA members in the work of Europeana. It was great to hear some Councillors share their personal journeys and experience with the ENA. In an effort to help new professionals in the Europeana ecosystem and connect them with more experienced network members, a buddy system was introduced during a social event that followed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2021 Council elections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the Council said goodbye to 17 Councillors that have reached the end of their terms: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/georgia-angelaki\">Georgia Angelaki</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ina-bluemel\">Ina Blümel</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/petra-boettinger\">Petra Boettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/erik-buelinckx\">Erik Buelinckx</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/tamara-butigan\">Tamara Butigan</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/michal-cudrnak\">Michal Cudrnák</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/olimpia-curta\">Olimpia Curta</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/maria-engberg\">Maria Engberg</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/barbara-fischer\">Barbara Fischer</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/karin-glasemann\">Karin Glasemann</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pilar-irala-hortal\">Pilar Irala-Hortal</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/vera-kriezi\">Vera Kriezi</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/james-morley\">James Morley</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marta-musso\">Marta Musso</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/antje-schmidt\">Antje Schmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/frederik-truyen\">Frederik Truyen</a>.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Network Association is the driving force of Europeana and as of October 2021, it is made up of over 3,100 professionals interested in digital cultural heritage from Europe and beyond. Since 2020, we have been measuring members’ satisfaction and the outcomes of their participation, while considering what this means in terms of longer-term sector impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the impact assessment methodology set out in the Europeana Impact Playbook, a digital questionnaire was developed. This was adapted from the questionnaire used in 2020 - some questions were revised, deleted or added. The digital questionnaire was shared with Network members via the newsletter, as well as directly with the Members’ Council and with the communities. We received 323 responses, which, with around 3,000 Network members surveyed, represents at least a 10% response rate. This is the minimum that we aimed for in order to have a representative sample. The data were then analysed on Excel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Network is interdisciplinary - fewer than half of Network members identify as heritage professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Network is made up of those with many years’ experience, with those with over 20 years of&nbsp;experience most represented and students and those still in education least represented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Members are most likely to have been a member for two years or less (45%), with members for five to&nbsp;six years being the next most frequently selected category (28%).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engagement in the Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">12% of respondents consider themselves very active in the Network. These respondents were most likely to be long-term members of five to six years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">25% of respondents report not being very involved in the Network or Europeana’s activities (and of this group, 34% would like to be more involved).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">32% of respondents would like to be more involved in the Network but 34% of this group don’t know how to get more involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">55% of respondents suggested that they’d like to be more involved in the work of Network communities, Working Groups or Task Forces.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fewer respondents report encouraging others to explore Europeana’s services (2020: 64%, 2021: 50%) and there is a very small decrease in encouraging others to join the Network (a drop of 1%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Satisfaction with the Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">67% of members were either satisfied or completely satisfied with their Network experience, but 29% reported being neither dissatisfied or satisfied, perhaps reflecting a lack of engagement and activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">45% of respondents reported that Europeana Network Association activities or services have been beneficial for them throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Developing sector capacity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">65% of Network members suggest that the Network has some importance for their daily work, with 31% suggesting it has little or no importance.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">16% of respondents report that the Network had value in some way when applying for funding. 8% report that it helped secure funding.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There is an increase in members reporting that they have expanded their professional network (from 34% in 2020 to 41% in 2021) and that the Network has helped them collaborate with others (a rise from 20% to 31%). 45% of respondents would like the Network to organise more networking events and 20% would like more informal catch-ups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interdisciplinarity of the Network is clear, as is the desire for more opportunities to meet (either digitally or in person) and to collaborate. Interactivity with the Network appears to have decreased between 2020 and 2021. There are encouraging signs, however, relating to a desire to be more involved. Bearing this in mind, somewhat unexpectedly Network members report that membership had even greater value for them in all areas measured in 2021 than they did in 2020. This may be the result of increased digital activity (and the wider accessibility of digital formats) since the beginning of the pandemic. The lack of engagement of many Network members may play a role in their level of satisfaction with their experience, so increasing opportunities for members to get involved is strongly recommended.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the first time, we investigated economic impact directly as a result of Network membership, namely through securing project funding. This was reported by 8% of respondents, strengthening our argument that convening and strengthening a Network of professionals supports the sustainability of the sector. Furthermore, participants desire the Network to further support the capacity-building of the sector, though there are many ways in which the Network is asked to do this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report has been shared with the Membership Working Group, the ENA Members Council, and colleagues at the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This feature works by pulling translations from three different sources in a defined order of priority. When a person requests a translation of the item’s metadata, the system checks if the provider of that item (the cultural heritage institution), shared additional metadata in that language. If so, then we show that translation. If not, we check if a partner or project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment#enrich-your-own-metadata\">provided the translation as an enrichment</a>. If so, we show that enrichment. If not, we default to showing the automated translation, which is powered by the Google Translate API. Since the automated translation by Google is a paid service, we cap it after a set amount of translations per day, after which, the automated translation stops working for that day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, let’s assume that someone is looking at an item provided by an institution in the Dutch language. They also speak Spanish, so they decide to switch to Spanish. However, the metadata isn’t provided in Spanish by the institution, nor is it found in the enrichment; therefore, we will show the automated translation of the metadata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have chosen to use Google Translate for quality and the range of languages it covers, until a non-commercial service can provide comparable quality and completeness of translations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Browse collections of specific organisations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When visiting our website, people can now browse collections from specific organisations. This was partially possible before using the search filters, but we were encouraged by our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">aggregators</a> to also explore a more visual and curated approach that emphasises our close collaboration with our data partners. The result is a dedicated page for each partner institution or organisation that we work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This means that if someone was looking for all the items shared by their national library, they would be able to find a page dedicated to the library. One way to get to these pages is through an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/organisations\">overview page</a> containing a list of all organisations. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/discover-cultural-heritage-by-institution-with-our-new-organisation-pages\">Find out more about our new organisation pages</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Augmented Spanish search results</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since the beginning of December, audiences who browse the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/es\">website in the Spanish language</a> have been able to search and see results in both Spanish and English seamlessly.&nbsp;When someone enters a Spanish query in the search bar on the Spanish version of the Europeana website, we translate the query into English in the background. We then use the English query to find search results in both languages. The results presented to the person searching are therefore a mixture of Spanish and English. This allows people to find more accurate and augmented results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, for example, if you search for 'flower' in English, you will see results with the word 'flower' in the metadata (in the original metadata or the existing multilingual enrichments provided to us as mentioned above, which can have only partial coverage). That means that you will mostly get English results because the search functionality is looking for a direct match. Now on the Spanish version of the website, we introduced a change that surfaces both the direct matches of the Spanish search query and the English matches. So if you search for 'casa,' you will get results matching the word 'casa' and English results with the word 'house' because on the Spanish version of the website you are now searching across languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We limited the work to the Spanish version of the website for this first iteration to test and iterate on this solution before we proceed with rolling this out across the website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>This quarter in numbers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From September to the end of December&nbsp;2021, the Europeana website had just over 2 million visits, 4.3 million page views, and 3.2 million unique page views, reflecting engagement and interest in the cultural heritage shown through the Europeana website from audiences across Europe. In addition, we recorded almost 58,000 item downloads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe three most-liked items were <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/226/13228_RM_2019\">Monna Lisa e smiles</a> (provided by Associazione culturale GoTellGo), <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/2021012/app_si_A_III_1928\">Male Mandarin Duck</a> (provided by Finnish National Gallery) and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/15513/9330\">Pferdestudie zu \"Erzherzog Karl mit seinem Stab in der Schlacht bei Aspern\"</a> (provided by Austrian Gallery Belvedere).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March 2020, we launched the current version of the Europeana website. Now that all the features that were on&nbsp;what we called 'the classic website'&nbsp;have now been incorporated on the current website, we've retired the classic version as of 20 December 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will share more updates on new features in the coming year through Europeana Pro news. In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">explore the Europeana website</a> and enjoy the newly released features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage has a crucial role to play in education, and Europeana wants to bring this source of knowledge to every learner, educator and educational organisation. One of the ways that we do this is through education MOOCs - or Massive Online Open Courses - which allow large numbers of participants to learn new skills and develop their knowledge through online teaching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First run in 2021, the Europeana ‘Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ MOOC aims to increase trust in digital cultural heritage as a primary source and empower teachers to use digital technologies. Last year over 2,100 people from 67 countries registered for the course and 547 participants completed the MOOC and received a certificate. 99% of post-survey respondents rated the course as good or very good, and 95% agreed or agreed strongly that they will use the ideas and examples presented in the course in their everyday work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were delighted with the response to the MOOC, and in February 2022 we will run an updated version in English. In March we will offer three additional language versions - Greek, Italian and Croatian. Aligned with the ambitions of the EU Digital Education Action Plan, the online course will explore the educational potential of digital cultural heritage and support teachers and educators to efficiently integrate it into their lessons and practices, regardless of the subject they teach. The final goal is to design engaging content for students, museumgoers and lifelong learners in order to prepare them as active and responsible citizens and&nbsp;to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC makes use of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">digitised collection of cultural heritage</a> and content from the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>, where participants will find resources in multiple formats (pictures, videos, texts, 3D items) and multiple languages. It also features tools like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a> and other ready-made materials that educators can easily integrate in their educational activities. The course will introduce the learning scenario template and guide participants to use it and build their own. It includes a selection of videos with tested learning scenarios designed by educators from different countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course is organised around the principle of peer learning, with content designed to&nbsp;stimulate reflection and discussion so that participants can learn from each other’s experiences and ideas. In order to complete the course, participants are required to submit a final course product and review their peers’ work. Participants will receive a digital course certificate and digital course badge upon completion of the full course.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course also aims to foster connections between schools and cultural heritage institutions like museums and libraries. So whether you are a teacher (of any subject or level), a non-formal educator, or someone with an interest in designing educational activities using&nbsp;Europeana, we welcome your participation! Other educational professionals and stakeholders, like heads of schools, school support staff and policy makers in education and&nbsp; culture are welcome to join too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course starts on 7 February 2022&nbsp;and will run for 6.5 weeks.

The application explores every aspect of the Darwin Museum in detail whilst engaging people with a unique comic-book style background story and illustration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The central idea of the quest story is that it is the year 2057 and the visitor is carrying out DNA research to decipher the genome of all living things on earth (hence the name ‘Life Code’), helped by an artificial intelligence assistant. The quest is entertaining and educational with players interacting with real exhibits in augmented reality. It’s available for Android, iOS, Windows in the museum and online.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>It all started with a creative idea to change the way we use technology to learn and engage with culture. Lena Khanova, a student with disabilities participating in Microsoft's programme for young talents, ‘Get your hands on professional experience’ asked the question: what if we created an application that would allow people to actively participate in their museum experience, either in person or remotely, through augmented reality? Could we create an immersive experience for children and adults to spark a conversation with the content of the museum through a quest or challenge that would make museums fun for all visitors? The answer was ‘yes!’ The project quickly took shape and was successfully presented to the Microsoft philanthropy team and the Microsoft Russia team by Lena and her mentor Tim Cranton. This kicked off an effort to make the dream a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media/technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The project is based on augmented reality and cognitive technologies. Due to augmented reality, the visitor can see a digital layer of the museum and interact with exhibits. We used cognitive tech to create a very effective virtual assistant. An English voice capable of conveying a range of&nbsp; emotions was generated using Microsoft text-to-speech.</p>\r\n"

But they are delighted to know that this application has an educational side and provides the child with activities and puzzles with some wonderful unique features. Parents can get their children up and running with the application with very little support from the outset. And they are reassured to know that the application is child-friendly and at no point can the child access any unwanted in-app purchases, inappropriate content or in-depth menu systems.</p>\r\n"

Our visitors tell us they find the application a delight to use and enjoy the augmented reality. They particularly enjoy the puzzles and the back story behind the adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What have you learned about working with digital cultural heritage from this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was our first project working with a natural history museum, which is very different from arts museums. Recognising animals in augmented reality is more difficult than working with 2D images like paintings. 3D models of animals are very heavy and some of them have fur or feathers. We had to reinvent our approach on how to work with real time mobile 3D for this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What difference does winning an award like this make to your project or future work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Winning the Heritage in Motion award helped us to understand that our vision of ‘edutainment’ for museums was interesting for international museum professionals. It inspires us to scale this approach to other museums around the world.</p>\r\n"

As a key part of the European Commission’s digital decade, Europeana is at the heart of a <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-proposes-common-european-data-space-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a>, which aims to accelerate the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector and make more digitised cultural heritage available to all for reuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This needs high-quality, shareable data that’s accessible to our audiences in any&nbsp;of the 24 official EU languages, and data that can be used and reused in any number of ways.&nbsp;We’ll embrace artificial intelligence, machine-learning, automation and 3D to improve and enrich that data. And we’ll empower the cultural heritage sector’s digital transformation with digital skills and working processes so that it is efficient, effective and fit for the digital decade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Led by a renewed&nbsp; <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#supervisory-board\">Supervisory Board</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#advisory-board\">Advisory Board</a>, with a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/martina-bagnoli-elected-to-be-chair-of-the-europeana-foundation\">new chair</a> for 2022, the Europeana Foundation will implement improvements to our organisational and hybrid working processes, and to professional development programmes for our employees, with the aims of safeguarding our staff’s health and wellbeing and further aligning our day-to-day work with the organisation’s mission. In all, making the Europeana Foundation more flexible and resilient, not just for the remainder of the pandemic, but for good.</p>\r\n"

In 2022, we’ll combine our own organisational values with the European Commission’s digital principles to help shape the new common European data space and take steps towards creating the world we want.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Foundation’s work promotes democratising access to and participation in digital heritage.

                body: "<p>In autumn 2021, Europeana was proud to be part of the international jury for the annual and prestigious <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/\">Heritage in Motion awards</a>, run by Europa Nostra and the European Museum Academy.&nbsp; In this theme, we talk to the 2021 award winners and find out how the cultural heritage sector is using new digital technologies in their inspiring projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Amilcar Vargas, Responsible of World Heritage at <a href=\"https://www.casabatllo.es/en/\">Casa Batlló</a>, tells us about the Casa Batlló ‘10D Experience’, winner of the ‘Best Achievement Award’ and the ‘Games and Interactive experiences’ category.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Can you tell us a little bit about your winning project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project began in 2015 after we saw how happy visitors were to discover Casa Batlló (a UNESCO World Heritage site designed by Antonio Gaudí in Barcelona) with the help of a <a href=\"https://www.casabatllo.es/en/news/a-magical-experience-for-the-little-ones/\">smartphone</a> that expanded the contents through the use of Augmented Reality. There, we discovered that using innovation and technology in the service of culture could enable us to design the most fascinating cultural experience in the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.casabatllo.es/en/experience/\">10D experience</a> opens up 2,000 square metres of Casa Batllo that have never been seen before. The Gaudí Dôme uses more than 1,000 screens and 21 audio channels to share the origins of the inspiration of the genius Gaudí. And the Gaudí Cube is the first six-sided LED cube in the world, presenting the work of the digital artist Refik Anadol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJs4k8sQe4c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a lot of intense work, the 10D experience of Casa Batlló was nominated for a Heritage in Motion Award because of the outstanding combination of analogue and digital technologies. The work included a three-year long <a href=\"https://www.casabatllo.es/en/restoration/\">restoration</a> of the property and an update and upgrade of the visitor experience. We tried to enhance the discovery of Casa Batlló using cutting-edge technology and careful curatorship to merge contemporary and historical components easily and smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media/technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The technological interventions developed for the Casa Batlló experience take advantage of the best of traditional restoration techniques along with content curation that focuses on offering a journey into the mind of Gaudí. Through this experience, we can share with our visitors the art and nature that inspired the brilliant architect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new staging of Casa Batlló aims to preserve cultural heritage and renew its story through new technologies with the same innovative and disruptive spirit that characterised Antoni Gaudí. It is the most ambitious initiative in the history of Casa Batlló and aims to transcend the local and national sphere and become an essential landmark of the city of Barcelona. The technology has been selected carefully and integrated in a comprehensive customer experience using emotional storytelling to touch all the human senses. Technology has become a great ally for Casa Batlló, it does not replace the traditional heritage values but enhances them.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>How have your audiences reacted to this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, the full cultural experience is much appreciated and visitors rate the 75-minute experience very highly, rating it as 9/10, with 61% rating it with a score of 10. Some visitors highlight how impressive it is to see Gaudí's Cube, while others prefer the new audio guide narration and soundtrack. We have started to receive recognition and awards from all over the world and we are gaining many new followers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What have you learned about working with digital cultural heritage from this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everything we do challenges the status quo, and we believe that everything can be done differently. We challenge the status quo by creating a surprising and exciting experience, that is fun for all ages, and in which the beauty of Casa Batlló is discovered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve combined the desire to preserve the universal value of this UNESCO World Heritage Site with our passion for creativity and technological innovation to design one of the most immersive and multisensory experiences in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casa Batlló is always innovating and new content is planned as communication technologies and digital art evolve. We have taken a very important leap forward but the innovations do not end here. With this new cultural visit we are starting a new stage in the life of Casa Batlló and we want the world's leading audiovisual technology to find in our house of light and colour a welcoming space that increases the value of the house and the visitors’ experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What difference does winning an award like this make to your project/future work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Heritage in Motion Award is one of the greatest recognitions that Casa Batlló has received in recent times. It makes us feel very proud of the collective work carried out over more than six years in which hundreds of people from very different disciplines have participated. We believe that the other participants in this competition have made very important contributions to the world of museums and heritage, so we are very proud to have been selected by the jury to win the Games and Interaction category and the Best Achievement Award. At Casa Batlló we will continue to innovate and we hope that we will soon be able to add new content to the experience of those who come to visit us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow Casa Batlló on <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/casabatllo\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/casabatllo\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CasaBatlloGaudi/\">Twitter</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Hi. My name is Harry Verwayen. I serve as General Director of the Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here at the new year, I’d like to wish all of Europeana’s partners, stakeholders, and friends a very happy and, importantly, healthy year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your ongoing commitment and your collaboration with Europeana helps people connect with their past, and lets teachers, researchers, innovators, and creatives do incredible things with heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yet there are barriers we must keep working to overcome. Barriers in language and translation. In accessibility. In diversity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you’ve seen, though, we make the most progress when we work closely together—both across Europe, and across the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With your continued support, 2022 is going to be a big year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, we will become a key part of the European Commission’s ambitious <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade\">digital decade</a>. The commission intends to put Europeana at the heart of a European <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-proposes-common-european-data-space-cultural-heritage\">common data space for cultural heritage</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This provides us with an enormous opportunity to make more digital culture available to more people in more ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And this will also be challenging. To make this space a good space that is fair and inspiring will require collaboration, creativity and imagination. Your networks and your expertise are essential to help make that happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m hopeful and excited to see what we can do together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In anticipation of the ideas and partnerships we’ll nurture together in 2022, thank you!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2008, ‘a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away’, I started working at <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/culturaitalia\">CulturaItalia</a>, the Italian national aggregator. Aggregation was really at its beginning and I felt like a cowboy in front of an unexplored prairie!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started as a metadata specialist. Thanks to my background (I am an art historian) I had knowledge of cataloguing rules which was really useful to transform the information provided by our partners into metadata. Over the years I became technical coordinator of the portal and I am now leading CulturaItalia as Project coordinator.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the period we are living through, the activities seem to be ever increasing! So, my first commitment is to try to follow my agenda, even if, sometimes, I tend to be a bit messy…&nbsp; Jokes aside, I split my working day in two parts. During the first half I am devoted to CulturaItalia, and during the second, I work on European projects in which my institute, the <a href=\"https://www.iccu.sbn.it/en/\">ICCU</a>, is involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At CulturaItalia, in addition to ongoing administration (analysis and ingestion of new datasets, networking with thematic aggregators and content providers, coordination of activities), we are currently working hard to restyle our <a href=\"https://www.culturaitalia.it/opencms/index.jsp?language=en\">Portal</a>. I believe that every two, or at least three, years it is necessary to rethink aggregation strategies to meet the needs of the public and the technological development of our sector. So at the moment we are focused on the release of a new graphic interface, in order to develop our role as national aggregator for cultural heritage in a more incisive way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also working on two other fundamental aspects: the enrichment of metadata through the use of controlled vocabularies and the development of an IIIF compliant viewer. Both of these implementations are a ‘must have’ for aggregators that want to provide a real added value for their users, considering that the core of our public is represented by researchers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the moment I am working on several European projects as they are a pillar of ICCU’s strategies. We have built a strong connection with Europeana over the years; we participated in, among others, Athena, EuropeanaPhotography, Linked Heritage, PartagePlus, Athena+ and Common Culture. I am also involved in Europeana Sport; it is my first time as Project manager, and I must say that is an amazing experience, thanks to a wonderful consortium and the support of the ICCU staff. With their extraordinary effort, we are successfully achieving&nbsp;of the project's goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are at the beginning of the digital revolution, and this is reflected in the cultural heritage sector. Not everyone is always ready to face this transformation, and sometimes it is not easy to explain to other people the value of our activities, especially from an open data point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, I must say that in Italy we are making huge progress in this direction. The most important thematic aggregators have developed or are developing new strategies that strongly point towards open data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, my biggest challenge is also my favourite element: every time I am able to encourage a cultural institution to share the open vision, I can say ‘I am not alone in this fantastic (open) universe!’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I said, I was involved in several projects under the umbrella of Europeana and I know all of the problems that we meet in our work every day, so I wanted to make my experience available to all the members of the Association. Moreover, I am a ‘Europeana believer’ - I find the whole ecosystem an inspirational place where you can get ideas and proposals to improve your work. After all, one of the mantras of Europeana is ‘the more you give, the more you get’!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, last but not least, I believe it is a crucial moment for the development of new strategies and I want to play an active role from this point of view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If it is still not clear... open data! I want to use the opportunity to be a representative of a big community to communicate, inside and outside the Europeana Network Association, the added value of sharing content freely, at least for research and educational purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, I recently ‘discovered’ the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community</a> which, in my opinion, deals with one of the most important aspects of our work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every day we make available a huge amount of content to our public and only by understanding their needs and communicating correctly with them we can build an ever bigger and inclusive community.</p>\r\n"

Copyright Community members will be invited to actively participate. The Copyright Community and its Steering Group will also be called upon by Europeana Foundation to contribute their views to copyright policy questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. Identify the terminology we use when we talk about the different aspects of ‘open’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understand the various terms used in this space, their overlap and differences, and the contexts in which they might be most suitable to be used by the Europeana copyright community. This could include what we mean by ‘open’ and the perspective of ethics in the ‘open’ conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. Support the use of the out of commerce works provisions in the CDSM Directive&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example by creating best practice guidelines on how to use the provisions in practice, how to participate in stakeholder dialogues, and how to rely on the EUIPO portal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. Copyright office hours and Policy office hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue setting up the copyright office hours and start setting up the policy office hours to have a space where community members can engage and discuss shared questions. Each session will be focused on a specific topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4. Standardised rights information</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Promote the use of standardised rights information across European institutions, in particular by supporting the implementation of the Europeana Accuracy Strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. Copyright tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maintain a tools page where professionals in the sector can find copyright support. Explore contributing to CopyrightUser.eu and the Copyright Cortex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6. Guidelines to manage copyright for practitioners</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue to promote and update the guidelines to manage copyright for practitioners. Explore areas for further development, for example by going deeper into specific areas such as rights clearance to offer best practice, identify its cost, and harmonise practices across Europe. Create links with the copyright tools page, as well as with the Copyright Cortex and CopyrightUser.eu, and partner up with research centres and projects such as ReCreating Europe and inDICEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7. Explore ways to address copyright challenges to educational use of digital cultural heritage</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create, for example,&nbsp; support materials for educators navigating Europeana such as FAQs raising awareness of exceptions to copyright they can rely on and advocate for better exceptions to copyright for education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8. Test the Europeana Capacity Building Playbook</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Support the development of a draft Capacity Building Playbook by testing its approach and providing feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Outreach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will communicate and raise awareness of products, events and important developments through Europeana’s communication channels. Where relevant, we will invite members of the copyright community and other guests to write posts to be published at European Pro on relevant topics for the sector. Where possible, we will develop our products and services in collaboration with other Europeana communities and relevant partners and projects working on the same areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Budget*</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3000 eur. to be assigned to the research, production and design of materials to support the activities described in the work plan.</p>\r\n"

This should be done in close collaboration with the Europeana Foundation as well as involving the Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2) Continue to explore cutting-edge advancements in our sector.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similar to our approach to the AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force, we will issue open calls for new Task Forces and explore other cutting-edge advancements that can be used by the cultural heritage sector. Europeana’s Innovation Agenda should also be updated to reflect such advancements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3) Explore what the new recommendation on the European Digital Public Space means for the EuropeanaTech community, in particular regarding support for smaller cultural heritage organisations.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We intend to run a series of dedicated discussions and actions in this area of activity, including initiatives that are not currently directly related to Europeana’s remit of operation including digitisation and digital preservation. There is a definitive need, especially from small and medium institutions, for support in terms of skills, awareness, availability of costs and resources and services in the Cloud, which would cover all aspects from shelf to Europeana. This would help scale up digitisation efforts in Europe, in a way compliant with shared practices and standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022 we will focus - within the above mentioned main goals - on the following priority areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community priority areas&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our priority areas of focus directly align with the Europeana 2021-2025 strategy:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>“Tech is changing all the time. Reflecting its public service role, Europeana will develop and use cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, e-translation and machine learning in line with the European Commission’s Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI.”&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1) From shelf to Europeana: supporting the workflow&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to reach the goals specified in the European Digital Public Space proposals, organisations will need to increase their digital output and look at each step of the workflow between shelf and Europeana. We aim to encourage and support cultural heritage institutions - especially small and medium sized ones - at each step by sharing available best practices and Open Source tools. As each institution is different, the particular steps will have to be thoroughly adapted to local circumstances, including materials present, budget, the workforce, applicable laws etc. Next to the addition of new datasets to Europeana and opening them up for re- use, this will greatly contribute to the digital skills of the cultural heritage professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2) AI in relation to Cultural Heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will continue to support the community with AI related efforts following the conclusion of AI in Relation to GLAMs task force (future work on this topic will be done under a different name). These will include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Forming a EuropeanaTech AI Working Group. This Working Group will provide a space for discussion and expertise to continue the focused growth of AI within digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Coordinating and sharing knowledge from other AI related groups for instance, AI4Media, AI4LAMs, AI+Museums Network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Starting an inventory on national AI investments across EU27 and exploring the investments made in the Cultural and Creative Industries to highlight its significance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3) Multilingual discovery and access&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will investigate actions to enhance the multilingual coverage of vocabularies and to improve cross-vocabulary alignment. We will look at furthering Europeana’s work with relation to full-text, collaborating and sharing knowledge with the EuropeanaTech community and related centres of competence such as Impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4) 3D Content&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Steering Group will follow up on the efforts from the 3D Task Force in relation to 3D standards, accessibility and interoperability of digital representations through:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dialogue with IIIF 3D community, identifying use cases&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dialogue with 4CH - centre of competence on 3D in cultural heritage to identify common use cases&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Task forces and working groups&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>The EuropeanaTech Steering Group will organise another open call for task forces from the EuropeanaTech community. However, due to travel uncertainties and to discourage non-essential travel we will require all task forces to coordinate digitally.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The Audiovisual Task Force which was tabled for 2020 will resume activities in 2022. It will have a focus on the workflow from shelf to Europeana, including the restoration of material before digitisation.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The AI in Relation to GLAMs Task Force finished its activities in 2021. The steering group intends to follow up on the results by: publishing the datasets and other results of the winners of the open call for AI datasets; establishing a formal AI in Cultural Heritage Working Group.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The EuropeanaTech IIIF working group will continue to support the uptake of IIIF in the EuropeanaTech and Aggregator communities by exploring one off webinars and look to produce documents and other outputs that will help the community implement IIIF&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The Data Quality Committee will continue its work among others on normalisation of metadata and detection of problem patterns&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The Steering Group is considering starting a Task Force or Working Group on the use of Linked Open Data, especially Wikidata, in cultural heritage&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The Steering Group is considering starting a Task Force or Working Group on updating the FLOSS-service directory&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community outreach and communications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>EuropeanaTech will continue contributing new posts to Europeana Pro.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>More issues of EuropeanaTech Insight will be published in 2022.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>EuropeanaTech will further pursue the task of coordinating Twitter Takeovers to grow engagement on the @EuropeanaTech Twitter account&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>We will organise a series of small webinars in replacement of EuropeanaTech main event/conference in 2022 and will actively contribute to the development of the Europeana Capacity Building Framework&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">Collaborating on updating the Europeana Research and Innovation agenda (first published in 2018) with the network in such a way that it could inform the funding calls within Horizon Europe.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">Discussing with the Climate Action Community how we can work together on, for example, minimizing the carbon footprint of digitisation, processing and dissemination, and making sure climate is always one of our concerns in all projects.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">Discussing with the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force how we can work together (for example, around access for the visually impaired) and making sure diversity and inclusion aspects are always taken into consideration in all projects.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">Contributing to the shaping of the Common Data Space for Cultural Heritage.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Budget break-down*</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Looking Backwards | Smiling Forwards</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we are coming to the end of our second year of pandemic restrictions, we are beginning to sense that life is getting back on track. This is of course true of some countries more than others, but as a Pan-European community we are gradually getting back to our offices and our daily routines. What has been obvious over these past months are the powerful synergies that have pulsed across the Network, enabling us to work together and support each other to reach new heights. Our work together in the Communities, Task Forces and the Working Groups is inspiring. This report will detail some of the highlights of the year. There are many!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/Governance_documents/ENA-strategic-priorities-in-2021.pdf\">strategic priorities</a> that we first introduced in early 2021 have guided our actions and have supported capacity building towards digital transformation to drive all we do together. They were developed in a co-curated process with the ENA Management Board and approved by the Members Council in March 2021. They have fuelled our thinking in many ways and created an umbrella for our work together over this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In supporting capacity building and digital transformation we set ourselves the goal to define the main fields of competence where the Europeana Foundation can be most active through its ecosystem in promoting digital transformation. We understood that this process was poised to deliver a comprehensive package of capacity building support to cultural heritage institutions of all types and levels. Based on this, we identified how ENA can assume an important role in developing and strengthening these capacities by calling on its wide-reaching and embedded pool of active members, sharing knowledge and experiences and learning from each other. This can take place across cultural heritage domains and grassroots communities to help the Europeana mission succeed. A series of Town Hall meetings, for example, helped us formulate a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMDHvGNnzqK7FfBeHWeX4QQTxlErEygEjJItVcoaigk/edit\">white paper</a> on Digital Public Space<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMDHvGNnzqK7FfBeHWeX4QQTxlErEygEjJItVcoaigk\"> </a>with a goal to align the European Commission’s Cultural Heritage Data Space vision with a new and holistic articulation of a green, inclusive, people-centred, sustainable, commons-based digital cultural heritage space for the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harnessing the potential of ENA members was an obvious priority that demanded that we get a better understanding of ENA’s 3,200+ membership in order to channel the potential, skills and enthusiasm of active participants. We felt that this was a prerequisite for a sustainable and active network, but also took into consideration that not all members would be equally active and the needs of passive members should be taken into account. Diversity and inclusion was another of the areas we identified that would determine our mindful and vital growth together; a key decision to embrace diverse and inclusive representation in the Network was a step towards what we believe is critical for the success and growth of ENA. We also believe that this is a long-term thoughtful process that should become an integral part of all we do, rather than a separate strategy with isolated activities. With a call to deepen the collaboration between ENA, the Europeana Foundation (EF), the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) and wider network we identified scope for developing the&nbsp; benefits of the EF-ENA relationship, to increase the impact of EF's digital transformation mission both with the EF and EAF as well as ‘neighbouring’ networks outside the Europeana ecosystem. By working together in this way, ENA can keep providing a rich source of expertise to support the knowledge pool which exists within the Foundation, which delivers the Europeana strategy. Regular meetings and conversations also enabled the information flow and collaborative efforts between ENA, the EF and the EAF. Transparency, accountability and democracy of planning, communication and decision-making we felt was crucial for success and a positive alignment of this was vital for harmonious relations between the various mechanisms of ENA, with EF and EAF and opening up ways to collaborate with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">EF Advisory Board and&nbsp; Supervisory Board</a>. Funding and payments is still an area that needs constant monitoring when the existing ENA budget was underspent due to the effects of the pandemic not allowing for physical meetings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps our major celebration this year is the soon to be introduced Climate Action Community. We know that both as individuals and as a community we contribute to the climate crisis through our digital and non-digital activities. At the same time, we are convinced that the cultural heritage sector and Europeana have a responsibility to act. Driven by the tenacious ENA Climate Action Group, we are now looking forward to forming this seventh community! And together with the Europeana Foundation and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, we are working on a Climate Manifesto which emerges from a collective desire to foreground the climate crisis within the ENA and its communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ENA works both as a community of communities and through our individual capacity to exchange knowledge, expertise, and best practice in our special interest communities to call on members’ skill sets and enable all to make a real contribution. These synergies have been celebrated in our webinars, cafes, workshops and conferences. We come together to share our knowledge and experience with like minded heritage professionals from across Europe. We know that everyone can be an element of change in their own sphere. We also know that we make more impact when we work together. Together, we empower the cultural heritage sector by developing expertise, tools and policies to embrace digital change and encourage partnerships that foster innovation. ENA makes it easier for people to use cultural heritage for education, research, creation, and recreation and together our work contributes to an open, knowledgeable, and creative society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Susan Hazan, Chair of the Europeana Network Association</p>\r\n"

ENA aspirations for 2022&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, the Europeana Network Association (ENA) began to consider its future role within the Europeana Initiative (EI), alongside the Europeana Foundation (EF) and the Europeana Aggregators Forum (EAF), by developing our strategies to contribute on more equal terms to several new EI ‘cross-initiatives’ around digital transformation, diversity and inclusion and other important issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we enter 2022 - and as the renegotiation of Europeana’s contract with the European Commission (due in spring 2022) approaches - the ENA looks to understand further how a diverse, 3,200+ strong network of professionals, with access to an enormous body of knowledge, expertise and potential, can both contribute more actively to and further benefit from being part of the Europeana family.&nbsp; And in the process,&nbsp; provide an exemplary model for the whole cultural heritage sector and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ENA has some powerful instruments: a Members Council, Communities, Working Groups and Task Forces are already present and in many cases, delivering excellent results. How can we build on these - and the&nbsp; several initiatives launched during the period of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a>’s chairing of ENA - to extend ENA’ s potential as a two-way receptor and provider of transformational expertise?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will address this question through our activities in 2022. In short, our main efforts will be directed towards:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">continuing to develop, refine and deliver <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/Governance_documents/ENA-strategic-priorities-in-2021.pdf\">ENA’s strategy</a>, in the context of the overall <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana strategy</a> and its wider context, such as the Green Deal and Climate Action, New European Bauhaus and a Digital Space for Culture;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">defining more clearly what digital transformation means for ENA members and how Europeana can contribute to building capacity;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">strengthening communications with the wider network membership in general to ensure more transparency, participation and democracy;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">working with EF to improve the knowledge and information flow about our members preferences and responses;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">improving ‘onboarding’ guidance for new members;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">building on the recommendations of the New Professionals Task Force to pilot new support mechanisms for the active participation of many more ENA members;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">developing a cohesive paradigm for a long-term customer journey, professional engagement and progression of members within ENA and EI - drawing together existing and new thinking on things like buddying, mentoring, an academy and fellowships;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">identifying and assessing new sectors which are potential Europeana users or stakeholders and engaging professionals from them, if appropriate;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">encouraging and supporting diversity, representation and involvement of many kinds within the ENA membership and all its organisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>2. Main areas of activity&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout 2022, the activities of the ENA will be organised as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Members Council</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\"> Members Council</a>, a body of 36 elected ENA representatives, will aim to actively help the Europeana Initiative implement its Strategy and support the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector. 2021’s elections will result in 27 new or re-elected members joining the Council. The Council will meet three times to discuss the ENA’s priorities and progress towards the Europeana Strategy in line with activities of the Europeana Foundation and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum. Councillors will evaluate and steer the activities of the communities, Task Forces and Working Groups, and actively work to ensure their progress, as well as the state of ENA governance and budget. Councillors will also actively engage in activities supporting and expanding ENA’s communications efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Management Board</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> will continue to lead the development of the ENA’s strategic vision. At the end of 2021, four members of the Management Board will step down as their term will come to an end. New members will be elected by the Members Council to replace them in January 2022. The new Board will continue to oversee ENA governance, policies, budget and membership provisions. They will provide guidance and a governance framework for ENA Communities, Task Forces and Working Groups, including on evaluating the progress of their work in line with the strategic direction of the ENA. The Board will meet monthly and communicate regularly beyond that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA Communities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The communities are the ENA’s most important instrument in addressing the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions as they undergo digital transformation. The following six <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">ENA communities</a> have been active since 2018: EuropeanaTech, Research, Education, Copyright, Impact and Communicators. Additionally, in November 2021 another ENA community was introduced - the Climate Action Community. The communities will continue to function as trans-national networks of professionals and experts who come together to cultivate and share knowledge and practices around these topics. The members of a community can sign up to receive community newsletters, join various communication channels and social media groups, and attend community-related events and meetings. The major focus of the communities will be on implementing their 2022 work plans, including <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces\">Task Force</a> activities. The progress of these work plans will be monitored by the community Steering Groups, the Management Board and the Members Council.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA Membership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Active engagement and empowerment of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members\">ENA members</a> has been and will remain our key priority. In 2022, we will keep focusing our efforts to expand the ENA by attracting professionals from various backgrounds, working in areas related to cultural heritage, while keeping the existing network engaged and active. We expect to start 2022 with around 3,300 members. Based on the trend we have seen in 2021, we expect to gain on average 80 new members every month, and the overall membership number to increase by around 900 members by the end of the year. New members will be approved by the ENA Management Board on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA Working Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Governance Working Group</a> remains responsible for recommending to the Management Board and Members Council, as well as any changes in the underlying governance principles and procedures for ENA governance. A <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Membership Working Group</a> was established in 2021 and has a central role in assessing and implementing the&nbsp; recommendations of the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\"> New Professionals Task Force</a>. All the ENA Working Groups will report on their progress at Members Council meetings, including the General Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA General Assembly meeting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our members will have the opportunity to come together at the ENA General Assembly, which will most likely take place in November 2022. During the ENA General Assembly, they will be able to express their opinions on governance matters, approve key documents, and launch the 2022 Members Council elections and voting. The communities will have an opportunity to present their key activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ENA Communications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Pro website is the main source of information about the ENA and its activities. Throughout 2022, we will highlight the work of ENA communities through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro news</a> and continue with a dedicated series called ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=professionals+in+focus\">Professionals in Focus</a>’ to profile current Members Councillors. We will continue to work with the EF to improve the interface and navigation on Pro, and to make information about ENA more easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will continue to send out a monthly <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/documentation#network-association-newsletters\">Network Newsletter</a> to subscribed ENA members. It will be endorsed each month by the Members Council with different Councillors taking their turn as Editor-in-Chief. The Europeana <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\">LinkedIn Group</a> (6,166 members as of October 2021) will continue to provide a discussion forum for ENA members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will also promote our communication efforts and dedicated campaigns on Twitter using new ENA hashtags. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typed_query\">#AllezCulture</a> shows support for digital culture and the cultural heritage sector and can be used to promote digital culture in action or as a rallying call. The hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23europeanacommunities&amp;src=typed_query\">#EuropeanaCommunities</a> brings the ENA, its specialist communities and other Europeana-related networks together. We encourage you to use, follow and share these hashtags in your discussions and networking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As described in some of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explainer-what-will-the-new-eu-copyright-rules-change-for-europe-s-cultural-heritage-institutions\">previous posts</a> on the topic, the CDSM Directive, adopted in 2019, addresses some of the copyright challenges faced by the cultural heritage sector. For cultural heritage institutions to be able to fully rely on the solutions brought forward by the Directive, Member States need to complete the transposition process, which should result in a change of law at the national level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even though we are well past the transposition deadline (7 June 2021), and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_3902?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=14d27e1a3e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_07_26_11_26&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-14d27e1a3e-188979681\">European Commission initiated infringement proceedings</a> against most European Union Member States, 17 countries have yet to initiate or finalise the transposition process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of today, the countries who have national laws in place that transpose the CDSM Directive are Austria, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands and Spain. In <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-missed-deadline-the-state-of-play-of-the-copyright-directive\">our last post</a> on the transposition of the CDSM Directive we briefly commented on the Dutch, German and Hungarian details. Let’s take a look at some of the other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ireland</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Irish Government transposed the CDSM Directive through a <a href=\"https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/567/made/en/pdf\">statutory instrument</a> via secondary legislation, which means less involvement by the Parliament than in an ordinary legislative procedure. This has been an option followed by many other countries as part of the transposition process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the national transposition is overall faithful to the text of the Directive, it provides some positive additional details. For example, it clarifies what ‘expressly’ reserving rights for Text and Data Mining (TDM) entails, and provides extra information on the publicity measures needed from collective management organisations in the context of licences for out of commerce works. This offers more legal certainty for cultural heritage institutions. There are some other details that are less positive, such as around the storage of copies made for the purposes of Text and Data Mining, which place some burdens on researchers and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Irish transposition text has no mention of the CDSM Directive’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/keeping-digitised-works-in-the-public-domain-how-the-copyright-directive-makes-it-a-reality\">public domain provision</a>, which establishes that no neighbouring rights for non-original photography can be claimed on works of visual arts in the public domain. This is understandable, given that the Irish Copyright Act does not recognise such neighbouring rights protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Italy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Italian transposition was adopted in November through a <a href=\"https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2021-11-27&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=21G00192&amp;elenco30giorni=true\">Legislative Decree</a> approved by the Council of Ministers. There are some positive aspects, such as the possibility for researchers using the Text and Data Mining exception to not only make copies, ‘but also the communication to the public of the outcome of the research’, as described <a href=\"https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2021/11/italy-has-transposed-dsm-directive.html\">in this post by the IPKat</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, and as described by Communia in <a href=\"https://eurovision.communia-association.org/detail/italy/\">this webpage</a>, the exception for out of commerce works is narrower in scope than in the text of the directive, which results in less opportunities to digitise and make out of commerce works available .&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the publication of a <a href=\"https://boe.es/boe/dias/2021/11/03/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-17910.pdf\">Royal Decree</a>, a statutory instrument, the Spanish Parliament voted against adopting the text as it intended instead to have proper Parliamentary consultation. A date is now awaited for the Parliamentary debate to take place, where amendments can be introduced. This is rather <a href=\"https://www.fesabid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211105_Posicionamiento-DEMUD.pdf\">good news</a> given the multiple contradictions that the transposition text presented (both between articles of the transposition text, and between the transposition text and the Directive) which would have led to a legal insecurity for cultural heritage professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay tuned for more information on the implications of the transposition of the CDSM Directive for digital cultural heritage and the approaches taken by some member states by following this new Pro news series! We will share posts through Europeana Pro news and our social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to be the first to hear about these developments, network with peers and learn more about copyright and digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">join the Europeana Copyright Community</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In autumn 2021, Europeana was proud to be part of the international jury for the annual and prestigious <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/\">Heritage in Motion awards</a>, run by Europa Nostra and the European Museum Academy.&nbsp; In this theme, we talk to the 2021 award winners and find out how the cultural heritage sector is using new digital technologies in their inspiring projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Lisa Westcott Wilkins, Managing Director of <a href=\"https://digventures.com/\">DigVentures</a>, a platform that enables civic participation in archaeology and heritage projects, tells us about ‘Archaeology at Home’, winner of the ‘Website’ category.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nCan you tell us a little bit about your winning project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Archaeology at Home was our response to COVID. DigVenture’s audience includes a lot of non-archaeologists, professionals from all walks of life. Our online course, ‘<a href=\"https://digventures.com/courses/how-to-do-archaeology/\">How to do Archaeology</a>’ is really popular, so we thought, now everyone’s at home, let’s run it as a virtual field school - a dig-along. Over 8,000 people in 91 countries registered, including groups of university students whose field work had been cancelled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also started a Facebook study group and saw that people went beyond chatting about the course to also talking about the craziness of the pandemic. Ultimately, the course brought people together who had a shared interest in archaeology, but it also gave them a platform for another kind of shared experience helping each other through the devastation of the pandemic. That really blew us away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkjOD1WJ9Fo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second part of the project we pivoted our in-person <a href=\"https://digventures.com/projects/dignation/\">DigNation</a> festival online.&nbsp; We asked speakers to film themselves basically telling us where they should have been that summer so we could keep their research in front of everybody’s eyes. Over two days, we ended up with 3,000 people and 500 comments and questions for presenters. We had 32 teams of archaeologists from 26 countries sending videos about their work.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media/technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being online broke down a lot of the usual barriers to participation and diversified the audience. The digital became a great leveller and gave us a much bigger geographical spread, plus involvement of people from all walks of life. Everyone was at home, not just people with children or part-time jobs; every educational level, every kind of professional and life experience was represented. That really blew the doors wide open. There’s an acknowledged elitist perspective in the archaeology world that the ‘public’ doesn’t care or want to be involved in archaeology, but here we had direct and very loud evidence that this is not the case. If there are opportunities, then our project shows there is an audience waiting to take part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also allowed us to create a community of practice with our peers who had never spoken outside of academia about their work. There was work within the festival that would never have reached a general audience had it not moved online. We’re continuing to play with that model.</p>\r\n"

We opened a subscription model and a tip jar and got so many subscribers and donations that it exceeded our retail offer from the previous year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All we’ve heard from people is ‘more please’. More courses. More festivals. Please keep doing these things because it makes things possible that wouldn’t be otherwise for financial or health or climate reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the big effects on our business has been that what we called the ‘fifth trench’ - our digital and outreach wing - has become a 50% arm of our business, whereas before it was always subservient to what was going on in the physical trenches. Now we have the trenches and we have the digital. It really has changed how we operated as a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What have you learned about working with digital cultural heritage from this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve learned that the audiences are absolutely limitless and are very happy and willing to throw themselves into what you’re doing with participation as well as money. The ‘how do we make money out of this’ question is what’s preventing some big European cultural heritage institutions from taking digital seriously: they can’t see how doing cultural activity online is going to help because all they think about is euros and cents. I would agree that it’s definitely not an immediate gratification thing, but if you lean into it, have a good strategic plan for how digital is&nbsp;going to feed into your bottom line beyond just finances, then you’re going to see those huge&nbsp;benefits flowing into your organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhat difference does winning an award like this make to your project/future work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re incredibly proud. When the pandemic hit, we all really struggled - and then something magical happened. To have it recognised on a European level for its innovation, which is at&nbsp;the heart of what we do, is so important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The award put us in touch with a community of peers which we’ve really struggled to reach before. Meeting some of the other winners, for the first time we felt like we were talking to people who spoke the same language as us in terms of working with cultural heritage. It’s opened avenues. It’s just awesome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are inspired to continue to try to bring our work to the attention of people outside of the UK. Europe is more open-minded about the value of culture than the UK, which is at war with itself over culture. Everything we see coming out of Europe is saying ‘more culture’,&nbsp;culture is what’s going to bring us back from the edge. We want more of that. That’s the conversation we want to be in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow DigVentures on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedigventurers\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DigVentures\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/digventures-ltd\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DigVentures\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/digventures\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/digventures/\">Instagram</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In autumn 2021, Europeana was proud to be part of the international jury for the annual and prestigious <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/\">Heritage in Motion awards</a>, run by Europa Nostra and the European Museum Academy.&nbsp; In this theme, we talk to the 2021 award winners and find out how the cultural heritage sector is using new digital technologies in their inspiring projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Tom Brink, Head of Collections and Presentations&nbsp; at the Anne Frank House tells us about ‘Anne Frank video diary’, winner of the ‘Film and Video’ category.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nCan you tell us a little bit about your winning project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In search of a new way of telling Anne Frank’s life story to young people, Anne Frank House, in partnership with Every Media, developed the Anne Frank video diary. It is a YouTube series in 15 episodes based on the diary of Anne Frank.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWFjgWGI_YE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe>&nbsp;</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The premise is: what if, on 12 June 1942, Anne Frank had got a video camera as a birthday present, instead of a diary?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Anne Frank video diary, Luna Cruz Perez plays Anne Frank, sharing her life in the Secret Annex, her thoughts and her feelings with the camera. All characters, locations, and events in the series are based on Anne Frank's diary letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the video diary, ‘After the Arrest’, follows Anne’s life story after the period in hiding. From an indeterminate time and place, Anne looks back on the events after the arrest – the last six months of her life in the concentration camps – talking about them in monologues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media/technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With regard to production, the use of a ‘vlogging camera’ created the dynamism and intimacy we wanted for this ‘diary-like’ production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using YouTube enabled us to distribute the series on a platform everybody in our target group (mainly 10-20 years old) knows and uses. Also, it made it possible to add captions in multiple languages and to geo-fence in a few countries where Anne’s diary is still in copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We launched the project during the first lockdown in the Netherlands. It wasn't planned that way, but it made the project even more relatable for young people than it would have been in normal circumstances. Although there is of course a big difference between a lockdown and Anne’s situation hiding from persecution, we do encourage discussions amongst youngsters on this topic, which happen in the YouTube comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What have you learned about working with digital cultural heritage from this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have learned that modern media like YouTube and Instagram can create new points of entry for us to communicate with audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series encouraged people to visit the Anne Frank House. Shortly after the release, in the summer of 2020 more (Dutch) families were visiting the museum, many of them because kids convinced their parents to visit Anne’s hiding place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further afield, we saw an unexpected popularity in certain countries like Brazil and India, and think that we could expand the reach further. We used subtitles but are thinking about dubbing the series in English for a broader reach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What difference does winning an award like this make to your project/future work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were surprised to win this award, since the idea of a video diary seemed so obvious. Winning really strengthened our belief that looking for new, innovative ways to tell an ‘old’ story helps to engage new audiences. This is important from a heritage, societal and historical point of view.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Following the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-network-association-welcomes-its-27-new-members-councillors\">Members Council elections</a> in November 2021, seven Councillors came forward as candidates for the Europeana Network Association (ENA) Management Board. From 18 to 23 January 2022, the 36 Council representatives elected five of the nominees to form the new Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nRole of the Management Board</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Management Board leads the development of the ENA’s strategic vision. Board members also act as ENA’s legal representatives and decision-making executives, representing the ENA in strategic discussions within the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board members act as key ambassadors of Europeana and the ENA and offer guidance to its members. The Board oversees the ENA governance, sets its procedures and annual policy, and is responsible for the budget and delivery of formal reports. It also accepts new members, and provides guidance to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association/communities\">Europeana Network Association Communities</a> (and their Task Forces and Working Groups) and formally approves and evaluates their progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board is headed by the Chair, who acts as the voice of the ENA and chairs all the Management Board and Members Council meetings and the General Assembly. The Vice-Chair carries out these responsibilities in the Chair's absence and the Treasurer is responsible for the budget and financial resources. The Board members are accountable in their roles to the Members Council. These three roles will be decided upon during the first Board meeting on 31 January 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nAnd the newly elected Board members are…&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The seven candidates who ran for the elections were <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/robert-davies\">Rob Davies</a> (the current ENA Vice-Chair), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marianna-marcucci\">Marianna Marcucci</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/alexandra-milanova\">Alexandra Milanova</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fred-saunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sofie-taes\">Sofie Taes</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/dafydd-tudur\">Dafydd Tudur</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ines-vodopivec\">Ines Vodopivec</a>. 33 out of 36 Councillors participated in the election (92%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results are now in, and the elected Management Board representatives are:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/robert-davies\">Rob Davies</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marianna-marcucci\">Marianna Marcucci</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fred-saunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sofie-taes\">Sofie Taes</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/dafydd-tudur\">Dafydd Tudur</a>. They will join <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/milena-dobreva\">Milena Dobreva</a>, who joined the Board in 2021 and has two more years to serve.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations and thank you!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations and a warm welcome to the new Board; we are delighted to have them lead the ENA in the upcoming three years, and wish them the best of luck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe would like to thank all who ran for these elections, as well as the Councillors who voted to choose their new representatives - we are grateful for your valuable time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would also like to sincerely thank those Board Members who will be stepping down for all their dedication, expertise, fantastic work and achievements: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a> as the Chair, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/frederik-truyen\">Frederik Truyen</a> as the ENA Treasurer, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/georgia-angelaki\">Georgia Angelaki</a> as Vice-Chair 2019 to 2020, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/alexandra-angeletaki\">Alexandra Angeletaki</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It includes a visualisation of a map of the underwater site that shows their position within the submerged site, the possibility to acquire geo-localised data, the visualisation of additional information about specific points of interest, and communication with the surface operators through an underwater messaging system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most engaging feature of Divy is its Underwater Augmented Reality (UWAR), which delivers divers a new and more immersive experience than a classic recreational dive. The AR allows the diver to view&nbsp; hypothetical reconstructions of structures and artefacts in an underwater archaeological site, superimposing them and showing how the archaeological remains appeared in the past.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>3D Research Srl started developing this idea in 2014, when, thanks to a national project, we started to work on an underwater tablet. We wanted to overcome two of the biggest issues of underwater exploration: low visibility conditions that lead to less understanding of the underwater environment, and the fact that it’s impossible to use (Global Navigation Satellite System) sensors to locate divers underwater, as their signals are absorbed in water only a few centimetres below sea level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We created a custom mobile application that works as an underwater navigator, giving divers several features to support the exploration of an underwater site. We improved its features through several European research projects. Then, within iMARECulture, we developed the UWAR feature, which has been successfully tested in the Underwater Archaeological Park of Baiae, located in the volcanic area of the Phlegrean Fields, a few kilometres North of Naples (Italy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Divy and the UWAR system represent an innovative way to support divers while exploring underwater cultural heritage sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media/technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project relies on augmented reality technologies to provide divers with an innovative and immersive experience, enabling them to visualise a 3D hypothesis that depicts how the ancient ruins in the underwater archaeological site could have appeared in the past. The diver can activate the UWAR feature for specific AR zones that are displayed as an overlay over a map of the underwater site. They can switch between the visualisation representing the actual conditions of the ancient ruins in the underwater site and the hypothetical 3D reconstruction of how the site appeared in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZ3S_l3KuwM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The diver can choose between a top-view visualisation and a first-person view. The top-view is especially useful for orienting in the underwater environment whereas the first-person allows them to fully enjoy the AR view. While in AR mode and first-person view, the user can move around the tablet, rolling and pitching, to change the point-of-view of the camera.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>How have your audiences reacted to this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The system has been deployed in different underwater cultural heritage sites where several recreational and technical divers had the opportunity to use it. They enjoyed their time and claimed that these kinds of solutions have great potential in underwater archaeology and tourism. In particular, they found the interaction with the AR feature natural and they found the experience very engaging. Experts think that this technology could be very useful for professionals too, supporting surveys and documentation of underwater cultural heritage sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What have you learned about working with digital cultural heritage from this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to water turbidity and biological colonisation, pictures taken in the submerged environment seem to be hazy, in a similar way as when landscape photos are degraded by haze, fog or smoke. It was challenging to develop the UWAR feature dealing with underwater environmental conditions. We had to employ different techniques and implement different solutions to overcome all the challenges faced during the realisation of the Underwater Augmented Reality. In particular, we developed an innovative hybrid tracking solution that merges data coming from the acoustic navigation system and the internal sensors of the tablet to improve the localisation of the diver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project gave us the possibility to make further progress in underwater AR technology applied to cultural heritage, by providing a useful tool for tourist divers. What’s more, we had the chance to collaborate with experts to create the virtual hypothetical reconstructions of the sites and to collect their feedback to further improve our solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What difference does winning an award like this make to your project/future work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Achieving a special mention in the Heritage in Motion Award made us realise that our UWAR technology can be attractive not only for experienced divers but also for a wider audience of occasional divers or even for users that have never experienced a dive in an underwater archaeological site. It makes us feel very proud of the effort our team put into the whole project, in studying, analysing, designing, developing and testing this innovative solution to improve divers’ experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe that new technologies can enhance accessibility and valorisation of underwater cultural heritage, as well as raise awareness about the vast maritime heritage that the Mediterranean Sea holds. So, we will continue work on this topic, with the aim to make underwater cultural heritage accessible to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would like to thank all the partners of the iMARECulture project and all those who contributed to achieving this result.</p>\r\n"

What can you tell us about the European Heritage Youth Ambassadors Programme?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for opening this conversation! The European Heritage Youth Ambassadors Programme was launched one year ago and is a joint initiative of <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/\">Europa Nostra</a>, the European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage (<a href=\"https://www.esach.org/\">ESACH</a>) and the European Heritage Tribune (<a href=\"https://heritagetribune.eu/\">EHT</a>). It is a growing network of students and emerging professionals with a passion for our shared cultural heritage. Coming from all over Europe and beyond, they raise their voices and share their stories and experiences through various platforms and activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Ambassadors act as a bridge between the youth heritage movement, heritage organisations across Europe and European institutions. This provides them with networking and capacity-building opportunities, involves them in the policy-making process, and reinforces a mutually beneficial dialogue with established experts. 11 Youth Ambassadors opened the programme in 2021 and we are looking forward to launching the second cycle this February during an online ceremony.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/fkAm53JrGGM\">Listen to some of the Youth Ambassadors’ testimonials.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did the Ambassadors get up to in 2021?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2021 was a very active year for the Youth Ambassadors. Their role encompassed engagement on multiple levels, including representing the voice of young people within Europa Nostra’s activities, being reporters for the European Heritage Tribune in their own countries, and engaging in ESACH’s projects. Follow the hashtag #HeritageAmbassadors to discover their experiences on social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other highlights in 2021 included the <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/young-heritage-students-and-professionals-contribute-to-the-new-european-bauhaus-at-the-2021-esach-madrid-meeting/\">ESACH Madrid Meeting</a> focusing on the New European Bauhaus, as well as the awareness-raising campaigns on Europe Day and the International Day for Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). This work culminated with the group’s participation in Europa Nostra’s European Cultural Heritage Summit in Venice in September 2021. The Youth Ambassadors&nbsp;contributed to the <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/european-heritage-youth-ambassadors-actively-participated-in-the-summit-in-venice/\">three panel discussions </a>of the European Heritage Policy Agora as well as to the European Heritage Awards Ceremony.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>And what are their plans for the coming year?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the growing network, 2022 will allow at least as much engagement, ideas-sharing, creativity, and boost in heritage awareness-raising, which is especially exciting in the frame of the European Year of Youth. For this, we are planning plenty of (online) events and initiatives to further mobilise, build capacity and advocate for youth. We will share the programme soon!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in this work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital approach is now an integral part of our daily lives, and so of heritage related practices too. Heritage documentation, interpretation, and dissemination are also considered crucial tasks that rely heavily on digital approaches. The Youth Ambassadors shaped their interaction primarily via digital exchange. Their transmission of knowledge and dialogue was carried out online, during the monthly online meetings that we organise as well as via social media and platforms. While in-person meetings are more memorable, we believe the digital means of communication has numerous benefits, including increased reach, and higher interactivity&nbsp;and inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give someone just beginning their career in the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay connected! It is essential to meet your peers and open long-lasting dialogues to exchange experiences and best practices. We see an increasing number of networks opening for youth to have a say in policy and future shaping. It could also prove extremely useful to take up a mentor, either someone at the university or within a cultural heritage organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another suggestion would be to explore different experiences to help you decide which career path within the cultural heritage sector would be the most suitable. There is the collective 'in theory'&nbsp;(what we learn) vs '­in practice'&nbsp;(what we actually do) gap that can be overcome by joining volunteering&nbsp;projects and/or internships. Some volunteering programmes offer mobility opportunities across Europe such as the <a href=\"http://heritagevolunteers.eu/?fbclid=IwAR1o1r4Rj-t9X1Nbpq3Vwf2eCiWFf0ER-JrJ6p9QfI-lH3H1T_5CK-6EZ2k\">European Heritage Volunteers</a> and the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity_en\">European Solidarity Corps</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What opportunities can they take advantage of - and what challenges do they face?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heritage professionals in their early career should take advantage of as many opportunities as possible. The digital transition fostered inclusion and has made it easier to attend all sorts of online training, workshops, webinars, and conferences (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">see some examples</a>). Not only do these events facilitate networking and build capacity, but they can also provide a better overview of the heritage landscape at all levels of governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, it can be challenging for young professionals and students to find out about existing heritage organisations, opportunities and main actors. Our organisations are trying to bridge this gap as much as possible, and we encourage you to join <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/get-involved/join/free-membership-form-18-33-years-old/\">Europa Nostra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/become-a-member.html\">ESACH</a>, and subscribe to the <a href=\"https://heritagetribune.eu/newsletter/\">European Heritage Tribune Newsletter </a>to find out about new opportunities. Also, most of the young professionals we meet these days are still studying. Combining courses, assignments, and other work is challenging, but not impossible with a time management plan in place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to a cultural heritage institution or organisation that would like to involve and support students and new professionals in their work?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To mainstream a youth dimension into their activities! Young people are not only the future, they are the present and are active agents in the heritage field. It is vital to maintain an open dialogue with students and new professionals, by providing them a platform to voice their concerns and ideas for the future and enhance a fruitful intergenerational dialogue.&nbsp;As heritage organisations, it is our duty to ensure that the young generation is well equipped to face challenges affecting cultural heritage, and at the same time, to listen to their new ideas and perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can a student or new professional get involved in the programme?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to invite them to engage with the Youth Ambassadors' work – especially on Instagram (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europanostraeu/\">Europa Nostra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/esach_spirit\">ESACH</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/heritagetribune/\">EHT</a>) – to help increase the reach and visibility of the group’s awareness-raising and advocacy. Or reach out to the Ambassadors and, if they are based in the same country, have a (virtual) coffee to chat about cultural heritage. Hopefully, this would encourage them to apply, in the future, for the 2023 programme!</p>\r\n"

In 2021, in the face of unsettling times, we doubled down on what matters to us - harnessing cultural heritage to help create the fair and inspiring world we want to be part of. Thank you to all who have contributed their time, expertise and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have achieved a lot in the past year in our role as coordinator of the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure and as participants in other EU-funded projects. As ever, that’s down to the collaborative way that the Europeana Foundation and our partners, projects, networks and friends work together. As the war in Ukraine brings new challenges and perspectives, continuing this approach will be more important than ever to support the role of cultural heritage in society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />First of all, please share a little bit about yourself and your day-to-day role.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My name is Blandine Smilansky. I have worked at the House of European History since 2015, two years before it opened as a museum, and am Head of the Communications and Partnerships Department. This involves a range of activities providing multiple physical and digital entry points into the contents and programmes of the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What does digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector mean to you, personally?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is huge creative potential in digital transformation. By putting history into a digital space, you can see many more angles and allow even more perspectives than you can have in a physical space. It is quite exciting. But this kind of ‘no limits’ idea is also a bit scary - it’s certainly not less demanding or challenging than putting history into a physical space onsite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What led to the House of European History creating a new digital approach?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re a European museum and we tell a transnational story. We have a mission to speak to audiences that are not physically present or close to the museum. Digital allows us to tell the stories we want to tell as we aim to become increasingly audience-centred and increase participation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before having our digital strategy, we had a blended approach to physical and digital, for example with a permanent exhibition with interpretation and narration in 24 EU languages available through a multimedia tablet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many museums, in the pandemic, digital is the only way. The pandemic corresponded with the moment we decided to put our digital ideas into a real strategy, with short term, mid term and long term activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the key points of the new approach?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have a set of guiding principles. First is the blended approach that sees physical and digital complement and amplify each other. Next is multiperspectivity by design, allowing for multiple voices, different angles on historical events. Then we have a participation and collaborative approach, which we hope will lead in time to co-creation or user-generated content on our platforms. Finally, there’s a community building aspect - we want to use this digital space as a way to build our community across Europe, widening the audiences - to be a museum for all Europeans. We’ve seen that starting to work already - when we had to switch our events programme online, we had participants from Hungary, Poland, Spain and beyond Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tell us about the new collection that you have recently shared online.&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://historia-europa-ep.zetcom.net/en/\">online collection</a> highlights eight years of collecting for the House of European History. It showcases 50 items that have been photographed in high quality and documented by the curators. In addition to the general base story you’d find in the physical exhibitions, there is an extra layer of a curator’s note giving more insight into the history of the object, designed to enrich what you learn.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The collection is geographically and chronologically diverse and represents our permanent and temporary exhibitions as well as our public collecting actions, such as one on COVID. We’ve chosen objects that are especially revealing or potent, and have both a European relevance and a relevance for today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, I would like to mention <a href=\"https://historia-europa-ep.zetcom.net/en/collection/item/10126/\">Block 30 of the Dutch AIDS Memorial Quilt</a>, a significant example of the actions aimed at commemorating the victims of AIDS, a disease that first came from the United States before spreading throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Created as a memorial, these quilt blocks were also used as a powerful visual tool to raise awareness of the AIDS pandemic. Today, they are either kept by the NAME foundations or are being integrated into museum collections. This quilt block was donated to the House of European History by Aidsfonds/NAMENproject, the Netherlands, and was on display in the museum’s temporary exhibition Restless Youth, Growing up in Europe, 1945 till now, in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the next steps for the House of European History in terms of sharing your collections online?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re working on the next batch of objects to be uploaded and looking into how this online collection can become richer, more linked and possibly also offer some type of interactivity for audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want our online collection to be relevant and for our educators to reuse it for their learning programmes. We’re working on how it can become something we all benefit from across the museum sector, an online collection we can use in our programmes, and of course something that the public visitor enjoys. We’re exploring possibilities like tagging, creating your own gallery, and linking more to other collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What change do you hope to see for the House of European History as a result of your new digital approach?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope to see a leap forward in our ability to engage with a diversity of audiences. It’s about telling our stories differently, and making sure we have the right tools for it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, for our temporary exhibition on the history of waste in Europe that'll open in 2023, we are working on the physical exhibition as well as a website on which somebody who can't come to the exhibition in Brussels can experience it. We have a partnership with around 10 museums in Europe who will contribute content and co-organise activities. The online content will be a unique and comprehensive offer for digital audiences. And it gives these exhibitions an afterlife - which is a new thing that we have to build on and include in our work systematically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How does the strategy address building capacity for digital skills?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing we want to do is to try and use the knowhow in the institution - we’re a museum attached to the European Parliament where there is already knowledge, training opportunities and colleagues with expertise in digital engagement. And we are trying to recruit people who have those digital skills and background, or are trained in digital humanities, which is an interesting field combining history and the digital.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking specifically about digital transformation in museums - we look to what networks like Europeana, ICOM and NEMO offer and make sure we’re represented there. As well as your day job, you have to commit to time for training and there is a lot available at the moment for museums. And finally, the digital transformation we are undergoing informs also new recruitments in our museum team.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In autumn 2021, Europeana was proud to be part of the international jury for the annual and prestigious <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/\">Heritage in Motion awards</a>, run by Europa Nostra and the European Museum Academy.&nbsp; In this theme, we talk to the 2021 award winners and find out how the cultural heritage sector is using new digital technologies in their inspiring projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, María Zozaya, Nicola Schiavottiello and Fernando Mendes tell us about the Heritales film festival, which received a ‘Special Mention’ in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Can you tell us a little bit about your winning project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritales is an international film festival that promotes global heritage by focusing on the ‘seventh art’ of cinema. It began in 2016 because we wanted to share diverse narratives involving natural and cultural heritage. The Heritales project has always had a very idealistic idea of spreading the importance of heritage among our local communities - adults, children and families - where we’re based in Portugal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our programming is presented in different forms: movie screenings followed by debates with the directors themselves, workshops and conferences, and other types of narrative forms like installations, exhibitions, animations, video and table games. We even project heritage films and animations from across the world on our own platform, ‘<a href=\"https://www.heritales.org/wp/stagepage/\">Heritales Stage</a>’. Our films and events are presented in many languages because we want to contribute to adapting heritage traditions to modern languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By projecting cinema in public spaces, framed by our community outreach strategy, we have created the scaffolding for exchange between academia, the local community and our international visitors. The objective of Heritales is to engage all kinds of people, using our non-stop festival as an instrument for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did using digital media and technology make possible for this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital media has allowed us to reach broader audiences, faster, but digital media is also part of our philosophy. Our goal is to spread heritage in different ways, going beyond the traditional methods, ranging from storytelling to theatre or artistic installations. Therefore, the worlds of animation and moving images open up limitless opportunities to share traditional cultures, adapt them to the present day, unveil their enigmas, and tell the stories of their wins and losses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also interested in talking about culture and extinct traditions - the cinema, animations and documentaries that we project are essential for us to denounce the various forms of extinction of heritage. We do this via our programme choices (for example, ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT_4GB9TTCE&amp;t=10s\">Nawabi Baluchiari</a>’ by T. Banerjee, ‘<a href=\"https://www.heritales.org/wp/category/events2018-19/page/3/\">Torneiro da Mouraria</a>’ by T. Sarantopoulos) and with the help of our partners’ media actions linked to natural and cultural heritage defence (such as <a href=\"https://survivalbrasil.org/\">Survival Brasil</a>, <a href=\"https://incouk.wixsite.com/website\">Incomindios-UK</a>, <a href=\"https://crowdreciclyng.wordpress.com/\">Crowd-Recycling</a>, or ‘<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/09/endangeredhabitats.endangeredspecies\">Yasuni Green Gold</a>’ by G. Haro). We also project films with installations about the renewal of cultural heritage rituals (for example, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/431236726\">‘I’m burning</a>’ by Andreu Signes). The <a href=\"https://www.heritales.org/wp/calls-2/call-for-films-2022/\">call for films and animations about heritage for 2022</a> is open now!<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How have your audiences reacted to this project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are fortunate because the public responds very well to our activities. People appreciate&nbsp; the project, regardless of whether they are involved in presentations, debates, installations, or open space talks. Audiences attach on very different levels. In Trafaria, Lisbon and Évora, we have a loyal audience; some even participated in short films promoted by our members!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children are delighted when we have programmed installations or video games, while parents, educators and teachers also want to do more activities (therefore, we will programme more didactic sessions soon).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when we screen at conferences or European Researchers Night, people want to collaborate with us to screen our films. In general, our non-commercial programming is always received with great interest and curiosity. The organisations we collaborate with often invite us to come back. All that shows that many things can be done with a small budget and great enthusiasm!</p>\r\n"

An award endorsed by Europa Nostra and their relevant heritage institutions is unique for anyone linked to heritage defence. It is crucial to give visibility to the cultural assets or world traditions that we reveal in our sessions. It is essential to support independent cultural activity in European provincial cities (such as Évora or Trafaria); and <a href=\"https://heritales.hypotheses.org/heritales-permanent-team\">our team</a> represents citizens of Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, it confirms to the institutions that support our project that they are making a good bet, and gives a bonus to the country where we have our headquarters (Portugal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heritage in Motion award reminds us that it is worth being united in this beautiful effort, that we are not alone. It was essential to maintain confidence in ourselves. The jury director Takis Sarantopoulos, seeing the other magnificent nominees, expressed that we were in the role of David against Goliath. And as the Heritales festival co-director Maria Zozaya said at her presentation in Venice, just being nominated allowed the Heritales team to believe that&nbsp;dreams can come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Follow Heritales on their <a href=\"https://www.heritales.org/wp/\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://heritales.hypotheses.org/\">blog</a>, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/heritales\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://pt-br.facebook.com/heritales/\">Facebook</a>.</p>\r\n"

With novel publication formats and&nbsp;new tools and methodologies on and outside of Europeana, innovative modes of engagement resulted from what was initially a grave bump in the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To maximise the visibility of project activities and leverage the new collections contributed by partners, the project established a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/highlights-from-the-20th-century\">feature page dedicated to 20th century heritage</a> on the Europeana website. As well as being a point of entry to the 20th century entity collection, the page contains a wide range of editorials. The themes aimed to reach a varied audience - from people interested in cinema history to educators looking for material on milestones in political history, and fashion lovers eager to revisit 20th-century trends.</p>\r\n"

Two exhibitions (<em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/a-century-of-technology\">A Century of technology</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/family-matters\">Family matters</a></em>) and various blogs boasted a substantial amount of audiovisual material too. This was made possible by the migration of Europeana's blogs to Europeana's own platform, which made the use of copyrighted audiovisual material technically possible from 2021. This new functionality, combined with an agreement between XX project partners and Europeana that explicit permission of use by the content holder would allow for its inclusion, led to the publication of pieces of editorial <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />which prominently featured audiovisual material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/creating-podcasts-and-vlogs-with-audiovisual-cultural-heritage\">Europeana XX podcast and vlog series</a> were the first ever to be produced with Europeana content. As the audiovisual collections at the core of the project lent themselves perfectly to these formats, the project team experimented with concepts, styles and storyboards, delivering a varied range of audiovisual heritage experiences accessible via the 20th century feature page.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>From curation to co-creation - new tools</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The creation of this editorial was aided by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/user-galleries\">User Galleries&nbsp;tool</a>, developed in close collaboration with Europeana Foundation. Now part of the Europeana website, the tool allows users to create a personal account, keep track of favourite items, build collections and make them ‘public’. For the Europeana XX editorial group, the tool substantially shortened the workflow connected with creating galleries: a curator can now completely finish a gallery and share its unique web address with the Europeana team for validation and promotion.

The recommendation engine implements metadata algorithms and takes into account a person’s sessions, allowing curators to create user galleries faster and with more diverse content. The Europeana website includes ‘favourite’ buttons which allow people to ‘like’ items which also providing feedback to the recommendation engine so that it can make adjustments in real time. Additionally, Europeana XX has developed the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/heritage-metadata-automatic-translation-system\">first multilingual embedding model</a> for Europeana records, laying foundations for other AI based projects to experiment with Europeana data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Taking the Europeana experience off-site&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The User Gallery was also used to compile audiovisual collections for <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/engaging-students-with-audiovisual-heritage-through-subtitle-a-thons\">Subtitle-a-thons</a>, a new online crowdsourcing platform which allows people to create and add subtitles to archival audiovisual content. Virtually hosted in Warsaw, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Rome in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.eunicglobal.eu/\">EUNIC</a> partners, four challenges gathered international groups of language enthusiasts willing to test their subtitling skills in a gamified environment to increase the multilingual accessibility of audiovisual collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To involve other communities, Europeana XX curated a number of experiences with user engagement tools. With the <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/products/mupop\">MuPop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/products/qandr\">QANDR</a> apps, two pop-up exhibitions were created in Leuven and in the Hague, and an online interactive exhibition on <a href=\"https://j-story.jhn.ngo/jewish-women-exhibit/#1-jewish-women\">20th century Jewish women</a> was made with the JStory platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>A <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/efha-unifi-journeys-in-the-xx-archive/\">workshop</a> carried out in collaboration between EFHA and the Design Department (DIDA) of the University of Florence also took place in the context of the project. Students were encouraged to use the digital artefacts available in Europeana’s fashion collections to revive past brands through their heritage. Tutor Margherita Tufarelli and Renato Stasi, of the Fashion Design Laboratory 2 at UNIFI, said: ‘Cultural heritage materials in the digital format represent a special resource because they are renewable, implementable, recombinable: the more they are used, the more our common heritage grows and evolves.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshop introduced archive use into designers’ training courses and aimed to familiarise them with existing structures, looking to the future with a vision of a continuously growing cultural heritage. The workshop reinvigorated the material kept by EFHA’s content providers and accessible through Europeana, presenting it as a resource for new design and creative productions. Margherita says: ‘The will to introduce archival research in the course stemmed from the desire to stimulate an approach of continuity with the heritage of the discipline (fashion) itself, considered not only something we observe but don’t touch, but actually something we continuously reconfigure and update.’ <a href=\"https://www.archivejourneys.fashionheritage.eu/\">See the results of the workshop</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The development of these new tools have not only facilitated the work of content creators and editors, but also turned end users into co-creators. The interactive exhibitions and gamification of crowdsourcing activities allowed people to interact with archival materials in new ways, shifting from passive consumers to active participants and collaborators. These activities, as well as&nbsp;new tools and methodologies, represent an important stepping stone in Europeana’s continuous exploration of exciting publication formats, novel connections with users and synergies with its ecosystem of professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can discover all the tools developed through Europeana XX in the Europeana Pro&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/services-and-tools\">Services and Tools section</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;explore collections and stories from the 20th century on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/highlights-from-the-20th-century\">the Europeana website</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Telling new stories with Women’s History Month&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March each year, countries, institutions and individuals around the world mark Women’s History Month by celebrating women’s contributions to society, history, culture and science - among many other areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2016, Europeana has celebrated Women’s History Month by highlighting the stories of important women in history, creating and promoting editorial to improve the representation of women on our websites. Building on this initial engagement, we developed a more structured and focused approach, leading to our landmark exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers: Trailblazing women in the arts and sciences</a>, which highlighted the lives of eight remarkable women from Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since then, we’ve continued to publish new stories on this topic, collaborated with partner institutions and social media platforms to promote them and <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/?s=women\">created learning materials</a> highlighting women’s contributions to history. We also published a series of interviews featuring key female influencers in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=women+in+culture+and+tech&amp;page_search=1\">culture and tech</a> and women leading <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=pioneering+ai+for+digital+cultural+heritage\">AI research</a> in the cultural heritage sector. What we’ve learned from these activities continues to shape how we approach diversifying our editorial and how we make our writing more inclusive and accessible. We still have work to do to surface stories of marginalised women from&nbsp;diverse backgrounds and reflect a more representative image of women in our society - <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />something we started and will continue to do this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our plans in 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, we are looking forward to once again sharing stories of women from both history and the present day through our editorial, social media, online courses and partnerships. We will promote exhibitions on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/women-writing-birds\">Women writing birds</a> and on author and women’s rights campaigner <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/louise-weiss-a-committed-european\">Louise Weiss</a>, and we'll highlight women from our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/black-lives-in-europe\">Black lives in Europe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/heroes-of-the-olympic-games\">Heroes of the Olympic Games</a> exhibitions. On International Women's Day, we will launch a new exhibition, The Pill, telling the story of the birth control pill as a game changer in the 20th century. And of course, editorials written with our partners across Europe will showcase stories about remarkable women while aiming to bring more light to marginalised women and the intersectionalities of their identities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On social media, organisations highlighting women’s history will take over our Instagram account to showcase their own collections and activities related to Women’s History Month. Following Women’s History Month, we will work with the DailyArt App to feature and promote artworks by female artists. And our successful <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=d2b7ca3067\">women’s history email course</a> will also be available for those who want the histories of remarkable women sent directly to their inboxes. There will also be a chance to help make less well known women’s stories more visible through a special run of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a>, which will invite participants to transcribe and annotate letters, diaries and documents written by women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, on Europeana Pro News, we will highlight projects and cultural heritage institutions to find out more about how they are marking the month, hoping to share and inspire with innovative examples from across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to help cultural heritage institutions to get involved in Women's History Month. Share inspirational stories from your own collections and let us know about your plans so we can explore ways to support them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Do your collections tell the story of an inspirational woman from history? Write an editorial piece for the Europeana website, or share it with us so that we can explore how to feature it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Does your institution plan to celebrate Women’s History Month? We can support your activities on social media or Europeana Pro News.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Does your institution have collections and content around women’s history? Promote relevant images, objects and blogs on social media. Use #WomensHistoryMonth and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Do you want to share our work? Follow, retweet and share our editorials and news posts throughout the month - we will be sharing them on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3201557/\">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do all of the above by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScu_9LafV4FdJIBNfpkBddBt9toEmx9J7Prc_roys6nyEhviw/viewform\">filling out our form</a> or getting in touch with editorial@europeana.eu.</p>\r\n"

To make this ambition a reality that works for and with the cultural heritage sector, it is essential that cultural heritage institutions, content aggregators and Member States policymakers all work together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The success of Europeana has always relied on the strength of national and domain infrastructures’, says Harry Verwayen, General Director of Europeana Foundation. ‘Without it, everything else fails. The recently published plans from the European Commission are very ambitious, and for it to succeed we need the entire ecosystem to be tuned in.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marie-Véronique Leroi, Chair of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, says, ‘2022 is a turning point on many levels: from the Commission’s Digital Decade strategy; to Europeana becoming an essential element of the common European data space for cultural heritage; and to our national perspective on strategic frameworks for cultural data and content. The French presidency of the Council of the EU addresses many topics of importance for the cultural sector and the digital promotion of heritage is one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The French Presidency and especially this conference will bring together all the concerned stakeholders to discuss how publication and aggregation of content can contribute to building a common data space for cultural heritage and how strategic frameworks can support and impact the process positively. The conference aims to gather professionals from cultural heritage institutions, policymakers at national or local levels, aggregators (local, national, domain or thematic), Europeana and the Commission to discuss the key elements required to build the common European data space for cultural heritage, collaboratively.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana and France host one-day online conference</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In collaboration with the Mobilier National, and supported by Ministère de la Culture de la France, Europeana is running a full-day online event on 1 March 2022, on&nbsp; ‘Building the common European data space for cultural heritage together: The role of Europeana, content aggregation and strategic frameworks.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event will explore the creation of this data space in the context of the European Commission’s Recommendation 2021/1970 of 10 November 2021. The programme will help participants and the audience gain a better understanding of what the data space actually means to and for the different actors in the cultural sector and how we can work collectively and collaboratively to develop it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The audience includes the European Commission’s Expert Group on a Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, delegates from the French Ministry and French cultural heritage institutions, members of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, as well as the public - who this time are welcome to join the whole conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keynote speeches will be presented by the Minister of Culture of France Roselyne Bachelot and the European Commission’s Yvo Volman and Rehana Schwinninger-Ladak, and there will be talks, roundtable and panel discussions with a range of experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/building-the-common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage-together-tickets-260172361537\">Register now</a> and follow #PFUE2022&nbsp; #EU2022FR and @Europe2022FR on Twitter.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! What can you tell us about the Future is Heritage?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for having us! The Future is Heritage is an international network of young professionals, students, and enthusiasts that work or want to work in the European cultural heritage sector. We were founded in 2018 by the Dutch cultural heritage organisation Erfgoed Brabant, with the support of several partners, including Erfgoed Gelderland and Europa Nostra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a network, we strive for a more inclusive, equal&nbsp;and diverse sector by providing a platform where young people can show their talents, exchange knowledge and experiences with like-minded people, and participate in intergenerational conversations and collaborations. By hosting conferences, field schools, and other activities annually, we aim to build a strong creative, innovative community!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What projects are you currently focusing on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently we are focusing on an event that we intend to host later this year. During this event, which we will host in the context of the European Year of Youth, we will try to put an even bigger focus on intergenerational cooperation and dialogue than we have before.&nbsp;We are also focusing on intensifying our collaboration with like-minded organisations and networks. We have seen so many impressive and great initiatives, for instance, the activities hosted by ESACH, and believe that by joining forces the impact of our initiatives can only be extended even further.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A major event of yours last year was Heritage Field School - can you tell us a bit more about it?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was an event which we hosted in October 2021 in Arnhem (The Netherlands) and its surrounding area. After many lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very fortunate to be able to organise a live event! During the Field School, participants tackled issues from the European heritage field and challenges we all must face in our day-to-day life. For instance, how do we deal with the effects of climate change on cultural heritage? How do we make heritage inclusive and create a space where many different perspectives can be shared? How do we assign new meaning to monuments that have fallen out of use?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&nbsp;invite everyone to think with us and work on possible solutions for these issues. If you have ideas, an interesting project, or an approach, you can always get in contact (via <a href=\"http://w.hinrichs@erfgoedgelderland.nl\">w.hinrichs@erfgoedgelderland.nl</a>), and we will&nbsp;gladly explore how we can apply this in our activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in your work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the world of today, it is almost impossible not to undertake some sort of digital engagement or practice. As we saw through our Online Programme in 2020 (which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered instead of our in-person event), through digital technology we can connect and engage large numbers of people in many different ways, ways that we did not know before. Digital accessibility contributes to democratising the European heritage sector, as wherever you are, you are able to contribute to international debate and let your voice be heard throughout Europe and beyond. As the Future is Heritage, we are still exploring all the possibilities that digital technology can bring us to strengthen our network, improve our quality and expand our outreach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give someone just beginning their career in the cultural heritage sector? What opportunities should they take advantage of - and what challenges do they face?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I feel the professional journey of every individual is different. However, speaking from my own experience, I would advise you to always look beyond your own profession, work, culture, or region. As I discovered myself as a participant in previous Future is Heritage events, there are many like-minded people who face the same issues, but maybe they live on the other side of the continent. By attending events and taking part in network activities, you can exchange experiences and possible solutions with each other that can help you in your own work and development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to a cultural heritage institution who would like to involve and support students and new professionals in their work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe that you can support new professionals and students in many ways as a heritage institution. For example, by hiring young professionals in your organisation and providing substantive positions for interns you can create a gateway to acquire new perspectives, ideas, and dynamics. Through this, new professionals and students acquire concrete experiences and the opportunity to develop their own skills. It is a two-way street.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do not be scared to learn or try out new things, create a space for new ideas, and don’t be afraid to give new professionals or students some control. Our world is dynamic and continuously changing and evolving. Why shouldn’t heritage organisations and institutions, that are usually all about our world, do the same?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have any plans for the European Year of Youth?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, we do! The event we will host in the fall will be in light of the principles of the European Year of Youth. In addition to this, we hope to also host some (online) activities to invite even more people to exchange and share ideas, experiences, and knowledge and work towards a brighter future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can a student or new professional join The Future is Heritage?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining the Future Heritage is very simple! Just follow us on social media (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/captureheritage\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thefutureisheritage\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-future-is-heritage/?viewAsMember=true\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefutureisheritage/?hl=nl\">Instagram</a>) , keep an eye out on our website and join one of our activities or events! We have not structured a membership, intake interviews, or any other requirements, so you are free to join anytime.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you start by telling us about the International Council on Archives (ICA)?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: The ICA is the international professional association for recordkeepers and archivists. It offers support to the international community through training, networking, funding&nbsp;and learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is your New Professionals Programme, and how does it work to build capacity within the archive profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: The New Professionals Programme is designed to support future leaders of the recordkeeping and archival profession. It brings six students/new professionals from across the world to work together for a year, gaining skills in teamwork, leadership, communications, presentation and project management. It also provides networking opportunities and supports the participants through a mentoring programme. It is through our future leaders, who represent different regions, language groups, cultures and communities, that we disseminate knowledge and build capacity in the archives profession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What work and experience do participants gain? Does digital technology, practices or engagement play a role in this work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: Those selected get to experience attending and presenting at an ICA conference or congress, presenting an International Archives Week webinar, running the New Professionals Programme social media accounts and newsletter&nbsp;and developing a project with outcomes that support the international new professionals community. Each year’s cohort works together with the ICA team and their mentors to come up with a project that is achievable, topical, and relevant to them, with digital technology and work practices often a priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: For example, in 2021 the new professionals cohort focused on a group project on how digitisation strategies can foster social inclusivity and facilitate memory and respect. We conducted a survey on this topic, which served as a starting point for a roundtable discussion at the ICA conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Francesca</strong>: We also had the opportunity to engage with the wider ICA network through conducting the survey and meet with key figures in the ICA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give someone just beginning their career in the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: My advice is to participate in the community. People are always friendly and willing to share their knowledge, but you have to give something too to get the most benefits. Don’t be afraid to step up and have a go, everyone is really supportive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: There are many opportunities to learn. The pandemic has increased the trend towards virtual workshops and conferences (see the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">Europeana events page</a>). One can attend from anywhere, often even for free. Take advantage of these offers and always stay curious about topics you have never heard of before!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Francesca</strong>: Since starting my archive career, I have found this profession incredibly supportive. There are lots of learning opportunities and members of the community are always willing to share what to do, and also not what to do. Don’t be afraid to ask. Also value your previous experience, the cultural heritage sector can learn from you in the same way that you can learn from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What opportunities can new professionals take advantage of - and what challenges do they face?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: There are both opportunities and challenges for new professionals today and they differ globally. From my perspective in Australia, I think the biggest challenge is our job market for new professionals, where many have to take short-term, part-time contracts to gain employment in the sector. I would encourage anyone to make the most of the free resources that are made available across associations, including webinars, presentations, journals. If you can spend some money and join an association make sure you make the most of the benefits it offers such as applying for mentoring schemes, conference bursaries, and perhaps take on a role on a committee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Francesca</strong>: Similarly, in the UK there are lots of seminars, talks and free resources that you can take advantage of. With the pandemic these are increasingly accessible online. A big challenge can be gaining the necessary qualifications to work in the sector, there are very few bursaries available and often new professionals have to work while taking their qualifications over a few years or have to take a year off to complete a postgraduate qualification.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to a cultural heritage institution or organisation that would like to involve and support students and new professionals in their work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: Provide mentoring opportunities, support student placements, and host events where students and new professionals can meet your staff and learn from their expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elisabeth</strong>: Offer opportunities to write a thesis in collaboration with their own organisation or work together with student groups from universities to develop ideas or even practical solutions for their organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Francesca</strong>: Work with new professionals on projects and give them opportunities within your organisation to gain new skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have any plans for the European Year of Youth?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: The programme hopes to connect in with the European Year of Youth to reach new audiences, as our current cohort explores who are the new professional archival and recordkeeping community, and how they could feel more supported.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can a student or new professional get involved in the ICA?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nicola</strong>: <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Nicola: Students and new professionals are encouraged to follow our social media accounts on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ICANPs/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ICArchiv_NP\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/icanewprofessionals/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. Sign up to receive the <a href=\"https://www.ica.org/en/new-professionals-newsletter\">New Professionals newsletter</a>, and consider contributing to it, the <a href=\"https://blog-ica.org/\">ICA blog</a>, or even putting in a <a href=\"https://www.ica.org/en/ica-roma-conference-2022-call-for-papers\">paper for our next Conference</a>. You can become a <a href=\"https://www.ica.org/en/join-the-international-council-on-archives-0\">student member, or digital member</a>, and join your <a href=\"https://www.ica.org/en/ica-regional-branches\">regional branch</a> or look into the <a href=\"https://www.ica.org/en/ica-professional-sections\">Sections of the ICA</a>. The ICA has much to give, and you have much to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Francesca</strong>: As a new professional I know that we would have welcomed questions, or other new professionals reaching out to ask how to get involved. I’d say reach out to start a conversation.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Two new grants</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/\">Archives Portal Europe</a> (APE), one of the main Europeana aggregators for historical archives, launched two new grants to promote access and reuse of digitised archival material and to create high quality metadata to be shared on international levels. Both grants were meant to be implemented on a project basis and are part of APE’s contribution to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi-4\">Europeana DSI-4</a>. They were aimed at smaller institutions that might not have the means to be part of international initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first grant was a Metadata Ingestion grant, financed mostly independently by APE. This grant focused on the creation of new metadata for ingestion in APE and on the improvement of existing metadata for better retrieval of archival descriptions. The idea for this grant came from the realisation that there were no funds available to archives to work exclusively on these areas; as an institution dedicated first and foremost to the aggregation of archival descriptions, APE was eager to promote this work. The grant also enabled the creation of enhanced metadata following the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, such as the inclusion of contextual classes based on Linked Open Data vocabularies to foster discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">APE wanted to combine the Metadata Ingestion grant with another funding opportunity dedicated to improved&nbsp;access and reuse of digital archival collections, again following an integrated approach based on the Europeana&nbsp;Publishing Framework. The added value of digital objects was obvious, freeing archive users from long and expensive trips to access the material they need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second grant, the Digitise and Upload grant, was specifically aimed at collections to be shared not only in APE, but also in Europeana, and was allocated in the context of APE’s collaboration within Europeana DSI-4. The grants aimed to support archival institutions to improve access to digitised collections by, for example, integrating direct links to digital objects in the metadata, linking higher resolution images instead of publication versions, or fostering the use of more open licences and rights statements. Applicants to this grant were free in their choice of collections and were supported to prepare the metadata for ingestion in APE as well as aggregating the digital objects into Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Winners and collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In both 2021 and 2022, the grants have been received with a great deal of interest from the international archival community. In both years almost 20 institutions from several countries applied, making it a very difficult task to select the winners! Both grants were open to any institution in the world, whether or not already affiliated to APE or Europeana, as long as they presented collections related to Europe and were willing to accept the terms to become content providers for APE and/or Europeana. The winners were selected based on the potential interest of their collection for users and with the aim to showcase diverse places and historical periods, as well as to support smaller institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, there were two winners of the Metadata Ingestion grant. Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York (UK) ingested the <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/GB-193/type/fa/id/gb193-oury\">Oury Archive</a>, the personal collection of colonial-period railways magnate Libert Oury, into APE, making material about economic activities in Mozambique and Zambia available. The <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/directory/-/dir/content/FR-99999999999/fa\">Archives Municipales de Lyon</a> (France) used their grant to improve the metadata for collections related to the city that were already available in the portal.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Digitise and Upload grant winners were the Archive and Documentation Centre for Roman Catholic Friesland Foundation (ADRKF) from the Netherlands, which made the family archive of <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/NL-BwdADRKF/type/fa/id/NL-BwdADRKF-2\">Titus Brandsma</a>, one of the most important Catholic scholars in Dutch history, available on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?query=edm_datasetName%3A603_%2A\">Europeana</a> and APE. Additionally, the <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/TR-00000028922/type/fa/id/MHC\">Military History Collection</a> of Suna Kıraç Library at Koç University (Turkey) uncovers the lives of soldiers from the late Ottoman period to the early Republic years - see an image from the collection above. You can find more about the winners on the APE blog, with the full reports on the <a href=\"https://archivesportaleurope.blog/2021/12/09/the-titus-brandsma-family-archive-in-archives-portal-europe/\">Titus Brandsma project</a> and on the <a href=\"https://archivesportaleurope.blog/2022/01/27/the-military-history-collection-from-koc-university-suna-kirac-library-now-available-in-ape/\">Military Collection report</a> by Suna Kiraç Library.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The National Archives of Malta were the winners of the 2022 Digitise and Upload grant, with a project that will make a large collection of maps from the island&nbsp;available in digital form for the first time. The Narva City Archives in Estonia won the 2022 Metadata Ingestion grant, and will ingest most of their finding aids in APE. The 2022 grants are still in progress, and the final results should be available by July 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given the positive responses and results obtained from the grants, APE plans to make these a long-term commitment of its ingestion strategy. Even small grants like these (from 500 - 10,000 euros) can make a big difference for the digitisation of new collections, and hopefully more institutions in the position to organise small grants for ingestions will follow these steps.&nbsp;The 2023 call for the both grants will open in September 2023 and will be published on the APE blog and social media channels - follow them on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArchivesPortal\">@ArchivesPortal</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once upon a time … no, seriously, some time before the year 2000, I visited an exhibition in a Franciscan monastery in south-eastern Slovenia. There was a lovely collection of several old-masters prints on display, including some of Albrecht Dürer's single-sheet prints. In addition, there was also a beautiful 500-year-old library in all its glory. It was love at first sight, resulting in my enrolment in library and information science studies. After four years at the faculty I started my research work in that same Franciscan library. As the library was without a proper catalogue, it seemed reasonable to compile one, starting with its oldest and the most comprehensive collection of the 16th century printed editions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While working in the Franciscan monastery and continuing my studies at graduate level, I was employed as a researcher on international projects in the National and University Library of Slovenia. All projects were related to digitisation and digital enhancement tools, which gave me new experiences and knowledge of unlimited possibilities for accessing and reusing cultural heritage in the digital environment. The historical insight merged with modern technology into a new awareness, guiding me on a fascinating journey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After receiving my PhD degree in 2012, having two children, publishing two books and establishing a new university library at the Nova University, I came back&nbsp;to our National and University Library, to plan the development of the library operations and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the last year I’ve had the most honourable opportunity to cooperate in the Europeana Network Association Members Council, which I deeply appreciate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two major tasks that are in the spotlight of our work at the moment. The first is an international project <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/home\">Art of Reading in the Middle Ages</a>, of which our library is the coordinator. The project’s eight partners from seven European countries are working together to digitise, share and present medieval content with Europeana that could be applicable for a variety of purposes. It is a charming project with interesting <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/news\">results</a> for curators, educators, students, researchers as well as the general public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, I am putting all my efforts into the strategic development of digitisation in heritage institutions on a national level. I am focusing on data interoperability by fostering and enhancing the use of internationally adopted, standardised metadata models recommended by Europeana in different Slovenian GLAM institutions. We aim to build a sustainable and reliable common platform supporting the country’s heritage science, innovation and development. The National and University Library of Slovenia is already an established national aggregator and trusted partner of Europeana, which I find most important in terms of national policy planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are living in&nbsp; an age of digital renaissance; we are right in the middle of all the changes happening&nbsp; in our society. Of course, we are all, myself not withstanding, focusing on ‘everything digital’. We can only dream of and imagine what the aftermath of the digital baroque will bring us and when it will all start. So, the biggest challenge I see is in recognising future paths of development and key areas to be addressed today to stimulate that progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Progress and growth are also my favourite elements of work. Seeing results is what makes hard work worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have been following Europeana’s development since its beginning and from the first digitisation projects I worked on in 2009. The Association is, I guess, one of the most multidisciplinary networks of highly specialised professionals in Europe and one of the main cultural promoters of cross-border cooperation. The motivation is obvious – to be able to participate and learn from my colleagues, and possibly to participate in creating changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As elected Councillor my personal obligation is to accelerate transdisciplinary metadata connectivity beyond standardised schemes, to boost user experience and accessibility to digitised cultural heritage on European level. Therefore, to build on our common European identity founded on comparability and diversity of digitised cultural objects available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just recently I have also joined the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Europeana Research Community</a> Steering Group, where, I hope, I will be able to learn more about good practices of data connectivity and linking for access and reuse of digital cultural heritage in science. I look forward to actively participating in the Europeana Research Community by presenting the good practices and solutions started in our country.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us! Tell us about ESACH.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for inviting us! We are really grateful for the platform and support that Europeana offers to new and young professionals in the heritage sector. The European Students' Association for Cultural Heritage (ESACH) is a youth-led network of students and young professionals within cultural heritage based on the principles of interdisciplinarity and peer-to-peer learning. It was established in 2017, on the occasion of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, to highlight the perspective of the younger generations regarding cultural issues. Since then, ESACH has successfully established itself as a significant actor in the heritage landscape in Europe, in particular in the representation of young voices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can you tell us about your members?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of February 2022, ESACH has 504 members from 49 countries. The majority of our members are students or PhDs, but we also have members who are recent graduates and young professionals. Our members are most active in the fields of heritage management (29%), architecture and urban planning (23%) and archaeology (7%). The majority of our members (76%) are women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What projects are you currently focusing on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2022 is looking like an exciting year for youth and cultural heritage! We are developing a number of projects, thanks to the collaboration with our wonderful partners. We are currently on the second edition of the <a href=\"http://www.esach.org/ehya.html\">European Heritage Youth Ambassadors Programme</a>, in partnership with Europa Nostra and the European Heritage Tribune. The <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/get-involved/internships/\">Europa Nostra / EN Internship Programme</a> is also active, providing practical work experience to three to four young people per year. We are also looking forward to carrying out more activities to support our members in enhancing their employability, <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/subscribe-to-the-newsletter.html\">so stay posted for more news</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also focusing on a new round of <a href=\"http://www.esach.org/events.html\">ESACH Talks</a>. These are interactive, fast-paced events that provide a platform for sharing knowledge among students and young professionals working within cultural heritage studies. This year the ESACH Talks will be focusing on the European Year of Youth and highlighting youth initiatives in heritage across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, we will be releasing more editions of <a href=\"https://issuu.com/esach/docs/the_esach_quarterly_n_1_-_june_2021\">The ESACH Quarterly</a>: a peer-reviewed magazine of international scope that provides Open Access space for the dissemination of different experiences and points of view regarding cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practises or engagement play in your work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital technologies are essential to our work: as a remote network sustained by volunteers from a dozen different countries, we would not be able to exist without technologies such as social media and remote collaboration tools. The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to go completely online, expanding our network far beyond what is physically accessible. At the same time, moving online has made activities more accessible and reduced costs, allowing us to do more with less resources and a larger impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past two years, ESACH’s work on digital media has taken new importance and vitality. Our content development plan takes into account the main concerns of our network members to highlight the kind of information they want and need: internships, jobs, calls for papers, hands-on workshops, and opportunities for dialogue. We are always looking for fun new ways to connect with our network through a wide range of social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give someone just beginning their career in the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of things that you can do! Stay informed and don’t be afraid of reaching out for mentoring opportunities. The world of cultural heritage is going through a resurgence, and with it come many opportunities for emerging professionals who are willing to tackle the task of researching opportunities, get through applications, and nurture relationships. Get out there and be active; volunteer and join heritage organisations. It’s the best way to keep abreast of the opportunities out there. And talk to your peers! Heritage is a new and developing field, and we have so much to learn from each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to a cultural heritage institution or organisation that would like to involve and support students and new professionals in their work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions should ‘take advantage’ of young voices and their fresh ideas. Internships, for example, can benefit both the organisation and the applicant, and be instrumental for young graduates wanting to build their careers and contributing to a long lasting change. It’s important to ensure that they are given responsibility to oversee a particular task even if in a minor project. This will not only give them hands-on experience in the sector but also hone their existing skills. Institutions could also structure dynamic traineeship programmes according to a trainee’s academic stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Institutions should be aware of the type of students they are giving opportunities to. Not a lot of low income students are able to volunteer to do unpaid internships, but if we work to include these voices, we will have a&nbsp; more diverse cultural heritage sector. Open your doors and make young people feel motivated and valued by creating paid internships, traineeships, research groups&nbsp;and scholarships.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have any plans for the European Year of Youth?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes! We are currently working with our partners to finalise a plan for this year. One of our goals for this year is to ‘mainstream’ youth involvement as a key aspect of cultural heritage in all institutions, so we will be working with different partners to bring young voices to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since we truly believe in the positive impact of cultural heritage within society, another main goal is to empower young people to take ownership of their personal and cultural heritage and involve it in their personal and professional development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can a student or new professional get involved in ESACH?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/become-a-member.html\">join our international network today</a>, or connect with us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ESACHspirit/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/esach_spirit/?igshid=1d5lq9b4q3183\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/esach_spirit\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/esach-europe/\">LinkedIn</a>. Engage in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/201640350458668\">members group</a> on Facebook, tag us on your projects, or send us a message asking for help spreading your message to a broader audience. You can also subscribe to our newsletter!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Registration for our first <a href=\"https://5ekq3.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/8DfOpbhAoBetGqkdzOAy1Hh4DL0HAi6d2l0vo3yJcsOLPStMsZeiVLLvHMy4wOdl8m9bi-XRxqLBHuXbWM0X75Z-02gOcES2doK50YTKKzaeky0CcxyfmBVLern-TVHrvNqSmX9RvSthO-6oygXpvWjA2929eVitcB1c1ocw0laiyWELoU-bMl7KLCTqBfu9xnokaWQdCd0nCFI3iV8hK7twFlOOpSpq3v_rjso5VUqEwaYGjeKGSMAbKIpjH97OlYprwGmEwQKYLxedlsbs1CLofX4oc0kqRli5A_OhnMestQhL71nwWpX_jJeqzA\">ESACH Talks </a>of the year is now open, attendance is open to everyone. The following Talks will each feature four student/new professional presentations. We will launch a call for abstracts to select the speakers - if you have experience or ideas related to the theme we encourage you to apply. From undergraduates, to PhD students, to new professionals, we would love to hear from everyone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally, you can also volunteer to join our Coordination Committee! Open calls are regularly published online, and the The ESACH Publications Team is currently looking for new Editors and Graphic Designers. Polish your CV and send relevant examples of your work at <a href=\"mailto:esach.editor@gmail.com\">esach.editor@gmail.com</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative builds on a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">network of national, thematic and domain aggregators</a> which enable cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) to share their content with Europeana and open it up to new audiences. Aggregators work with thousands of cultural institutions and collectors to gather authentic, trustworthy and robust data and make it accessible to Europeana, and from there to education and research infrastructures, creatives, developers and the general public. As an important source of expertise, aggregators offer advice and support in digitisation, content description, metadata mapping, licensing, media formats accessibility, multilingualism and in domain and subject vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) coordinates all activities required for the effective functioning of a pan-European, cross-domain aggregation ecosystem at operational and strategic level. At operational level, accredited aggregators ensure the development and uptake of standards and frameworks and have an active role in shaping the aggregation process and outcomes. At a strategic level, we function as an advocacy body for pan-European aggregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, we collaborate closely with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">Europeana Network Association (ENA)</a>, and together with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation (EF)</a>, we work towards the overall strengthening of the Europeana initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Main areas of activity</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our activities in 2021 have covered the following range of areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Accreditation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF has an established accreditation process in order to accept new members. New applications for accreditation are evaluated by the EAF Steering Group and approved by the General Assembly of the EAF during the two EAF meetings in Spring and Autumn of each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, two aggregators received accreditation, namely the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture and Estonian e-Repository and Conservation of Collections, bringing the number of aggregators represented in the EAF to 40 (as of December 2021). The up to date list of all accredited aggregators to Europeana, as well as more information about them, can be found on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Pro</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF accreditation scheme was developed in 2018 and the first batch of 33 aggregators was accredited in 2019. Since then, seven more aggregators have joined the EAF. In 2021 we reviewed the scheme and updated a number of aspects to reflect the changes in the ecosystem and adjusted the benefits and responsibilities of aggregators. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOfjChpu6fZUpigH0RRfx8Vl9gpagQ9HpogMLI82qXU/edit?usp=sharing\">The updated accreditation scheme</a> was approved by the General Assembly of the EAF in autumn 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Governance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In spring 2021 we reached the end of the three year term of two elected members of the EAF Steering Group, Marco Rendina and Sara di Giorgio. We invited EAF members to step forward as candidates for the Steering Group, and received the applications of four strong candidates. Elections were held in May 2021 and Marie-Véronique Leroi and Nicole Emmenegger were elected to take the two vacant seats in the Steering Group. Following the elections, the Steering Group then appointed Marie-Véronique Leroi as chair and Kerstin Herlt as vice-chair. Next Steering Group elections are due in spring 2023, when the term for Kerstin Herlt will come to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Steering Group meetings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF Steering Group aims to meet about once a month and has held a total of 10 meetings in 2021. These meetings saw the preparation of the bi-annual EAF meetings, including Steering Group elections. Applications from aggregators for accreditation were reviewed and prepared to allow the EAF to vote. The initial preparation for the Aggregators’ Fair was carried out by the Steering Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Initiative wide aspects have also been dealt with during Steering Group meetings, including the alignment of activities with the ENA Management Board. Aspects related to diversity and inclusion and capacity building were on the agenda, as well as the EU recovery funds and contribution to the Europeana Conference 2021. In June, the Steering Group supported the handover of activities from the previous members (Marco Rendina &amp; Sara di Giorgio) to the new members (Marie-Veronique Leroi &amp; Nicole Emmenegger). A big thank you to Marco and Sara, the founding members of the EAF Steering Group, which was set up three years ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF and General Assembly meetings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 20 and 21 May 2021, EF hosted the spring edition of the EAF meeting online. 83 participants from 21 countries joined over both days and 35 aggregators (out of 40 accredited aggregators) participated in the event. The General Assembly, which is part of each EAF meeting, included the following topics: the accreditation of two new aggregators (Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture and Estonian e-Repository and Conservation of Collections); the European Commission’s Recovery and Resilience plan which provides financial support to the EU Member States to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis as well as a new cross-initiative Task Force on diversity, equity and inclusion. On the second day, we organised a training session on Artificial Intelligence (AI) which introduced tools and best practice examples developed mainly as part of Generic Services projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2021, the EAF opened their virtual doors and organised the first <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-aggregators-fair\">Europeana Aggregators Fair</a>. The two day event offered cultural heritage professionals the opportunity to look behind the scenes of the aggregation process, join panel discussions about user engagement and capacity building and hear about Linked Data activities, digital storytelling, and much more. With 90 professionals attending and a satisfaction rate of more than 80%, the first Aggregators’ Fair was successful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The autumn meeting of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) was again held online on 26 and 27 October 2021. It followed a similar agenda structure compared to previous meetings. On the first day,&nbsp; we kicked off with the General Assembly&nbsp; where we, among others, signed off the revised version of the accreditation scheme. Marie-Véronique Leroi presented EU funding opportunities for cultural heritage institutions and aggregators. We initiated a working group to address equity, diversity and inclusivity in cultural heritage data and collection building. The second day was dedicated to the progress made on implementing IIIF, with many contributions from EAF members. This programme also set the scene for the next steps of the Europeana Tech / EAF IIIF working group. Around 60 people from 31 of our 40 accredited aggregators participated in the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Task Forces and Working Groups</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Aggregators User Group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Aggregators’ User Group was&nbsp; set up in 2020 to provide and channel feedback to the EF on its range of products (including the Europeana website, Metis and the Europeana Pro website). The group met in 2021 on a regular basis (about once a month). The agenda included: organisation pages on the Europeana website, the Jira workflow, incremental data processing, Europeana website filters, the Data Quality Statistics Dashboard and the Knowledge Base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>IIIF and Europeana Working Group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The IIIF and Europeana Working Group was first proposed at the autumn 2019 EAF meeting and started work in 2020 with a series of training workshops. After the end of this series of workshops, the Working Group reviewed its status and set new goals for the next phase. Part of this work was a IIIF-focused day at the autumn 2021 EAF meeting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two years after the idea for a Working Group was born, it is impressive to see how many aggregators are now working with IIIF. In addition, it is obvious that more aggregators are interested to learn about IIIF; one conclusion of the IIIF day was that the technical barriers to work with IIIF are still too high and that the available guidance material is still not sufficient to allow for a wider adoption of IIIF. It was agreed that the Working Group should invest in a different type of training activities to&nbsp; help partners with less well developed technical skills and/or infrastructures to benefit from IIIF when sharing their digital media online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Libraries Working Group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The idea to set up a Libraries Working Group (LWG) under the EAF was proposed in 2020. The terms of reference for the LWG were developed in 2021 with the goal to launch the group later in the year. The launch of the LWG was delayed to align with the release of the first version of the Metis Sandbox. Our aim remains to establish a group of library experts under the umbrella of the EAF which will support national libraries that have no aggregator to prepare and publish their data with Europeana. This group will also work as requirement providers for the further implementation of the Europeana Aggregation Strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Transformation Task Force</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2021 a Europeana Initiative Task Force was set up to guide the development of Europeana’s Capacity Building Framework. This <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/digital-transformation-task-force\">Digital Transformation Task Force</a> runs until March 2022 and aims to develop a vision of what digital transformation looks like in the sector in all its different facets, and begin to plan out how to support, enable and measure it. Kerstin Arnold and Chiara Latronico represent the EAF in this Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Diversity and inclusion Task Force and DSI aggregator’s working group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2021, a call for representatives from the EAF was launched for an Initiative-wide Task Force on diversity and inclusion that will begin in 2022. Valentina Bachi and Julia Welter have applied to represent the EAF. Meanwhile, a working group bringing together aggregators from the DSI consortium will explore this theme and the&nbsp; specific challenges related to aggregation and working with content providers. The group had an initial meeting in late 2021 and will continue its work over the course of 2022 in the context of the DSI-4 project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF collaboration with ENA and the Europeana Foundation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Joint meetings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, representatives of the EAF Steering Group and ENA Management Board held two meetings (in February and June) with an aim to exchange information and look for opportunities for closer collaboration. Since summer 2021, these meetings have evolved into monthly cross-Europeana Initiative strategy meetings with the representatives of the EF. This alignment of the EAF, ENA and the Foundation allows the three pillars of the Europeana Initiative to work together more closely and to be actively involved in formulating joint positions on topics of common interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, in August 2021, on behalf of the Europeana Initiative, EAF together with the Foundation and ENA submitted a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/consultation-on-a-declaration-of-digital-principles\">joint response</a> to the European Commission’s consultation on digital principles providing the basis of Europe’s digital environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF’s role in cross-Europeana Initiative Task Forces&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The closer alignment of the three Europeana Initiative pillars was also reflected in the launch of several cross-Initiative Task Forces, which allow us to optimise performance and our individual and collective actions across the Initiative (see above).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, in June, EAF representatives took part in a joint cross-Initiative series of workshops dedicated to developing a common Europeana Initiative Community Pact with consultant Lauren Vargas. The process aimed to introduce community management approaches that enable inclusive conversations in the Europeana ecosystem. The Community Pact outlines how Europeana can operationalise its values and sets expectations how it and the community will engage with each other. Its purpose is to create trust and safe spaces for civil digital dialogue, and to outline accountability measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Community Pact was drafted during autumn of 2021 and is currently being reviewed and finalised. A cross-Initiative Task Force on diversity and inclusion has been set up as the next step in the process (see above).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Involvement of the EAF Steering Group in EF and Initiative actions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marie-Veronique Leroi and Nicole Emmenegger represented the EAF Steering Group in the call for proposal committee for the Europeana Conference 2021, and Kerstin Herlt was a member of the programme committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF Steering Group was also asked to contribute, review and endorse certain strategic documents issued by the Europeana Initiative. The EAF Steering Group participated in the statement on the New European Bauhaus, a joint position paper addressing how Europeana and the digital cultural heritage sector can contribute to the New European Bauhaus. The EAF Steering Group also contributed to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Europeana Climate Action Manifesto</a>. The position paper as part of the consultation on a '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/consultation-on-a-declaration-of-digital-principles\">Declaration of Digital Principles</a>' was submitted as a joint position from the Europeana Foundation, Europeana Network Association, and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum. In the same way, the EAF Steering Group contributed to the Europeana Initiative position on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-initiative-position-consultation-on-opportunities-offered-by-digital-technologies\">consultation on opportunities offered by digital technologies</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Communication</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF continues to use Basecamp for communication towards and between its members, including separate groups for aggregators who are part of the DSI. We continue to share public news relevant to aggregators through Europeana Pro, in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/documentation\">ENA newsletter</a> and, where relevant, through social media messages. More targeted messages are sent to promote events and news of interest to aggregators such as announcing new accreditations or funding opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We promoted the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-aggregators-forum-looking-forward-to-2021\">activity report 2020 and activity plan 2021</a> and also announced the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/register-for-the-first-ever-europeana-aggregators-fair\">registration of the Aggregators’ Fair</a> on Europeana Pro news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pro news post, ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/sharing-heritage-and-building-capacity-with-the-europeana-aggregators-forum\">Sharing heritage and building capacity with the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a>’ published in July 2021 and co-written by Marco Rendina and Marie-Véronique Leroi, gave a comprehensive update of activities and future plans and passed the baton from the former to the new Steering Group members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2021, Marie-Véronique Leroi gave an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-european-bauhaus-an-interview-with-marie-veronique-leroi\">interview</a> in the context of a Europeana Pro theme on the New European Bauhaus. She reflected on how the New European Bauhaus can be relevant in the context of the EAF and how it can support a digital vision for cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Members of the EAF Steering Group have also taken part in various Europeana-related events to represent the EAF.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>EAF aspirations&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative builds on a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">network of national, thematic and domain aggregators</a> which enable cultural heritage institutions to share their content with Europeana and open it up to new audiences. Aggregators work with thousands of cultural institutions and collectors to gather authentic, trustworthy and robust data and make it accessible to Europeana, and from there to education and research infrastructures, creatives, developers and the general public. As an important source of expertise, aggregators offer advice and support in digitisation, content description, metadata mapping, copyright and licensing, media formats accessibility, multilingualism and in domain and subject vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) coordinates all activities required for the effective functioning of a pan-European cross-domain aggregation ecosystem at operational and strategic level. At operational level, accredited aggregators ensure the development and uptake of standards and frameworks and have an active role in shaping the aggregation process and outcomes. At a strategic level, the EAF functions as an advocacy body for pan-European aggregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our main goal for 2022 is to support cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) across Europe to seize digital opportunities to make their collections accessible online in high quality. In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation (EF)</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">Europeana Network Association (ENA)</a> we support Europe’s archives, libraries and museums in their digital transformation, so they are able to create maximum value with their digital collections and services, either individually or collectively, via the Europeana platform or other channels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, our objectives for 2022 will be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to expand and strengthen the EAF and support emerging aggregators to join the network;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to increase the value for EAF members by creating opportunities for collaboration in working groups;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to work more closely with the EF and ENA on a Capacity Building Framework and the topic of Diversity and Inclusion via the dedicated Initiative Task Forces;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to provide input to the tender under the DEP programme, in collaboration with EF and ENA;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to continue to engage accredited aggregators in improving the Europeana aggregation infrastructure and other Europeana products;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to further improve data quality of the aggregated content;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to continue to advocate at European Commission and Member States level to strengthen and promote the role of domain, thematic and national aggregators;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to gather and share funding possibilities for the cultural heritage sector;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">to continue to support CHIs and data partners in the digital transition, as a joint effort with ENA and EF.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;Areas of activity</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our 2022 activities will cover the following range of areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Aggregators’ Forum Steering Group</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group is responsible for the management of the EAF. It consists of three representatives from accredited aggregators elected by the General Assembly of the EAF and one representative from the EF. The EF representative runs the EAF secretariat together with EF’s Network and Policy Officer in charge of the ENA Secretariat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will set the agenda for the bi-annual EAF meetings, organise and chair these meetings and ensure participation of relevant members. The Steering Group prepares communication on aggregator relevant aspects for the EAF Basecamp project and asks aggregators for feedback and input to relevant topics. It advocates visibility (e.g. Pro, events) and recognition of the role of aggregators in the ecosystem, and facilitates and supports the EAF in the DSI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EF supports aggregators attending the EAF meetings, ensures and safeguards consistent messaging and branding and involves aggregators in EF activities. The Steering Group will hold virtual meetings every one or two months (depending on coordination needs of the EAF) and communicate regularly.&nbsp; The Steering Group represents the EAF in conferences and events organised by the European Commission and Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Conference - Building the common European data space for cultural heritage together:&nbsp; The role of Europeana, content aggregation and strategic frameworks - under the French Presidency of the EU</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In collaboration with Mobilier National and the French Ministry of Culture and under the auspices of the French Presidency of the Council, Europeana is organising an online conference on 1 March 2022 (09:00-16:30 CET).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference 'Building the common European data space for cultural heritage together: The role of Europeana, content aggregation and strategic frameworks' explores the creation of the Data Space for Cultural Heritage. It takes place in the context of the European Commission’s Recommendation 2021/1970 of 10 November 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The audience will include the members of&nbsp; the European Commission’s Expert Group on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (CEDCHE), delegates from the French Ministry and French cultural heritage institutions, aggregators and other professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the first time, this presidency event will be completely public and open to aggregators as aggregation is one of the key elements that will be discussed in the perspective of the European common data space on cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Task Forces and Working Groups</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From 2020 it is possible to propose and run Task Forces and Working Groups inside the EAF. In order to avoid duplication and possible overlaps, this activity will be carried out in close coordination with the ENA secretariat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Aggregators User (Working) Group</strong> is a mechanism to engage with our key products. For products aggregators have a stake in, it will transparently facilitate the feedback loop between the EAF and the EF product development teams. Its activities started in November 2020 and will continue into 2022. The group will report twice a year to the bi-annual EAF meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>IIIF Working Group</strong>, running since 2020, will continue its work in 2022 with more individual workshops for aggregators. It also aims to provide some more practical guidelines focussed on the needs of the aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Libraries Working Group</strong> (first proposed in 2020) will be launched in 2022 and will start with exploring how to support national libraries that would like to work more closely with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Diversity and Inclusivity Working Group for DSI aggregators</strong> started in December 2021. The aim of the group is to assess the issue of difficult and discriminatory language and representation in data and collections, to design case studies and to come up with recommendations for data partners and aggregators in August 2022. The Working Group contributes to the EI Diversity and Inclusion Task Force that will kick off in 2022, with two representatives from the EAF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>EI Digital Transformation Task Force</strong> will conclude its work in 2022. It will then produce an action plan for adoption across Europeana Initiative stakeholders that includes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">recommendations for activities to support and guide the sector</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">recommendations for the future of the Digital Transformation Taskforce and the possibility of a longer term working group to continue to support this work</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">recommendations on the assessment and measurement of digital transformation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">a review of the current definition of digital transformation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Accreditation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of January 2022, 40 aggregators are represented in the EAF. More information can be found about accredited aggregators on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">Europeana Pro</a>. New applications for accreditation are evaluated by the EAF Steering Group and approved by the General Assembly of the EAF at least once a year (see below). The EAF Steering Group will also review the accreditation status of aggregators and review compliance with the accreditation criteria every two years for Aggregators as documented in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOfjChpu6fZUpigH0RRfx8Vl9gpagQ9HpogMLI82qXU/edit#heading=h.hiujgakd0w0\">Accreditation For Europeana Aggregators</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF and General Assembly meetings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accredited aggregators come together twice a year for the meetings of the EAF. A General Assembly meeting is part of every EAF meeting. In 2022 one EAF and General Assembly meeting will take place in spring (4-&nbsp; 5 April 2022) and the second in autumn. The spring edition will be a hybrid meeting with a small group of aggregators meeting at the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision, with others joining online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the second day of this meeting we plan to explore how we can collaborate to build the European data space for cultural heritage together. In this context we would like to promote the collaborative nature of the EAF and to shape the community feeling in and beyond the EAF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF Steering Group meets regularly with the ENA Management Board. Currently these Cross-Initiative Strategy Meetings take place once a month. EAF representatives are also members of the Europeana Supervisory and Advisory Boards. Beside that, there will be regular updates on EAF activities given at the ENA Members Council meetings (three times a year), as well as ENA activity updates provided at the EAF meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Communications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022 we are going to review the representation of the EAF on Europeana Pro. This will include reviewing aggregator pages, which will be refreshed in line with the updates of the organisation entities on the Europeana website. Now that we have generated an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/organisations\">organisation page</a> for every organisation that publishes data on the Europeana website, we need to ensure that aggregator names and further information published on Pro are in alignment with these pages. In addition, we will explore how to improve the presence of the EAF on Europeana Pro to have a more balanced representation of all three pillars of the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF uses Basecamp for communication with its members. We highlight news relevant to aggregators in the monthly <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/documentation#newsletters\">Network Newsletter</a>. If the amount of relevant content grows in the near future, the EAF could consider sending out its own newsletter. There will also be a closer collaboration between the ENA and EAF on Europeana Pro news, writing on topics like capacity building and diversity and inclusion. Every EAF member is encouraged to share new developments, success stories and highlights To do so, they can contact the EAF Steering Group so that possibilities for publication on Europeana Pro can be explored, together with the EF Marcomms team. As a starting point, updates can also be shared more often on the EAF Basecamp.</p>\r\n"

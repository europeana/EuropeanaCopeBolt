        title: 'Next steps for the Europeana Foundation on diversity and inclusivity'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In 2020, the Europeana Foundation made its belief in diversity explicit in its organisational <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#europeana-foundation\">statement</a> that ‘cultural heritage empowers us to embrace our diversity and flourish’. To make that belief a reality, we are working to make sure diversity and inclusivity is reflected in the many areas of our work - from the data we collect to the stories we tell, the events we organise and the communities we nurture. We have to work hard and take the time required to explore more ways to make sure we are indeed embracing diversity and implementing practical measures to embed it in our organisation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>There are many elements to diversity and inclusivity. We can think, for example, about age, sex and sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, country of origin or residence, ability or disability. And when we’re talking about inclusivity in representing the work of the cultural heritage sector, we also acknowledge diversity in domain, from small to large, private to public, from library to archive, museum and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an independent organisation, the Europeana Foundation employs over 60 staff members of more than 20 nationalities, each with their own rich heritage. We have a responsibility to lead discussions and processes that will better our understanding and promotion of diversity and inclusivity within the organisation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our approach</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While we at the Europeana Foundation have always been committed to increasing our understanding and promotion of diversity, there is much still to do and we continue to learn and evolve as an organisation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago, our focus was on bringing together the diversity of domains within the cultural heritage sector, helping museums, galleries, libraries and archives to talk to each other and recognise and navigate issues they share.\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, we have run public campaigns like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/looking-back-at-the-europeana-migration-campaign\">Europeana Migration</a>, which was part of our celebration of the European Year of Cultural Heritage, promoting the positive role of migration in our rich European history.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently we started contributing to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History Month</a> with blogs, galleries and exhibitions on our collections website and our season on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=women+in+culture\">Women in Culture and Technology</a> on our professional website. Organisationally, we have a ‘No woman, no panel’ policy for staff members invited to present at events.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will continue these, and other initiatives,\_such as making diversity and inclusivity an ongoing element of our strategy for the editorial we produce (see for example <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries/growing-up-black\">Growing Up Black</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/pride-in-europeana-victorian-dragqueens\">Pride in Europeana: Victorian Dragqueens</a>). And we are looking at how we can further address the range of issues relating to diversity and inclusivity, particularly the diversity of ethnic backgrounds, awareness of which continues to increase due to the global actions of the Black Lives Matter movement.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make sure that we understand, represent and include the whole of our society in the work that we do. This will take time. But we want to be transparent about where we stand as an organisation, and how we can work together to progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we’re going to do next</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We will make diversity and inclusivity one of the priorities in the Europeana Foundation’s Business Plan for 2021 so that we can be transparent and accountable for our actions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We will formalise our internal diversity and inclusivity team so that we can embed its role in our organisation to encourage and increase diversity and inclusivity activities.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We will, together with the Europeana Network Association and Aggregators’ Forum, develop peer-to-peer workshops led by experts in the field of diversity and inclusion so that we can develop a better understanding of the challenges we face and develop a roadmap of actions and activities.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that these steps will pave the way for more. We will continue to refine our approaches and adapt, and we will keep you updated on our activities and upcoming actions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will continue to respect each other, to treat each other equally, to acknowledge our mistakes and to learn from them and hope to build trust until we are where we need to be - in a position in which we truly are all empowered to embrace diversity and flourish.\_\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Addressing broken links to digital objects - our approach'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana website provides access to digital representations of millions of cultural heritage objects from all over Europe, and we want to give our audiences the best possible experience when exploring them. In this post, we tell you how we are working with our aggregators to address the issue of broken links.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana website provides access to digital representations of millions of cultural heritage objects from all over Europe. These digital representations are accessible via links provided with the metadata that we publish on the Europeana website. However, links sometimes break, which can be a frustrating experience for website visitors and users of our API.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broken links have a variety of origins: from projects ending and image collections being taken offline, to institutions migrating their collections to a new platform internally and not implementing redirections or using persistent identifiers. Broken links also vary in nature: some are temporarily broken, some permanently, and others may just appear to be broken for some users depending on access conditions set by the data provider. This makes resolving this issue a challenging task.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A new process to address broken links</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation product teams are working on ways to effectively identify broken links and address them. In the spring of 2020, we developed a tool based on the Metis Media Service that checks links in a small sample of records in every dataset published on the Europeana website once a week. The tool produces a report for every link it finds that has a problem, and specifies the problem with the link - for example, that it is not accessible at all (error code 404), that an object behind a link is only accessible after redirection or that a link does not look safe for a browser to open. Every three months we will produce a consolidated report, to get a full overview of the datasets where problems with links are consistently reported in this three month period.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report will be the basis for a manual check to confirm that links are really broken and the errors reported by the tool are correct. In this step we will exclude datasets where links have other issues but are not broken. Time out, SSL issues and temporary technical issues will not count as broken links and will be removed from the report and addressed separately. After this clean up step, the report should only include datasets where links are really broken and access to objects is not possible for people or machines.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first report of this kind has already been shared with our aggregators, and a second one will be generated at the end of March 2021. All broken link datasets present in both this first and second report will be depublished from the Europeana website in early April. This means that the datasets will not be accessible via the Europeana website, but will still be accessible via the preview environment. So if the broken links are later fixed, it would be possible to bring the datasets back to the website. This cycle will be continued throughout 2021 to ensure that our links stay up to date.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Working with our data partners</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have asked all of our aggregators to set aside time to check these reports and fix any issues that they can by the end of March. We are also planning to reach out to data partners that are inactive, or we no longer have contact with, to engage them in this body of work and ensure the best experience of cultural heritage objects that we can provide.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a cultural heritage institution which provides data to Europeana and are concerned about broken links in your data, please reach out to your <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">aggregator</a>\_or to me (<a href=\"mailto:henning.scholz@europeana.eu\">henning.scholz@europeana.eu</a>) to discuss further!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the call</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) have helped push technological boundaries in various domains, including in the cultural heritage sector (see examples in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/Final_Interim_Report_AI_in_GLAMs_TF.pdf\">Interim Report</a> of the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">AI in relation to GLAMs&nbsp;Task Force</a> or the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam\">AI4LAM</a> initiative).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many AI/ML methods of interest to applications in GLAMs are supervised; for example, they work by training a predictor (like a neural network) using ground truth (<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />ideal and expected outputs) or labeled data, from which the method is able to learn and infer a model. In order for the model to generalise well and perform accurate predictions for a wide array of inputs, its training data need to be of sufficient volume, quality and be representative for the domain from which it is sampled. Otherwise, there is a risk of overfitting (the model will only make good predictions for inputs that are very similar to the training data) or the introduction of biases, which will not only reduce the model’s general applicability and performance, but can also entail ethically problematic or otherwise unintended side-effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The GLAM sector is well positioned for the takeup of AI/ML in the sense that curated and diverse data of sufficient volume, quality and diversity in the form of digital collections from GLAMs (such as those aggregated and provided by Europeana), are now widely available under open licenses. What is currently lacking is the wider availability of datasets from the GLAM sector that are appropriate for direct use in the context of AI/ML research and development. The availability of such open datasets could not only help foster more engagement with digital cultural heritage data in AI/ML, but also support the transfer of recent advances in AI/ML to the field of digital curation and analysis of cultural heritage content. On the other hand, further advances in AI/ML often go hand in hand with the release of new high-quality datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EuropeanaTech therefore invites proposals for the assembly of suitable AI/ML datasets, drawing from the extensive <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections\">collections on the Europeana website</a>. We are seeking proposals for the creation of large, well-documented datasets that are shaped for direct takeup for AI/ML purposes (such as training a model) and that can be made publicly available on relevant online platforms under open licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will award the two winning proposals a financial stipend of €2,500 to support the production, documentation and publication of the datasets. Award winners will be invited to present their contributions at a future Europeana (online) event and provide a text for publication related to their outputs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to apply&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>To apply, please read the submission guidelines below and submit a proposal by 15 February&nbsp;2021, 23:59 CET.</strong> Proposals should describe in less than 1,500 words:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The intended contents of the dataset (in terms of volume, types of assets, annotation, etc.)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The procedure you intended to follow for producing the dataset&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How it is relevant for AI/ML.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposals should also include a suggestion for a possible use case, supported by a pre-trained model with a demonstration or evaluation of its results. In case of acceptance, it must be feasible to produce and release the dataset and all necessary documentation and technical resources before <strong>30 June 2021</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European cultural heritage collections are commonly&nbsp;subject to biases and entail ethical issues. While this can negatively impact AI and machine learning solutions, AI and machine learning could also be used to uncover these issues. These issues might not be overcome within the scope of this call, but we advise you to document and discuss them.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the Shannon Scheme and how you engage audiences in the topic?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Deirdre McParland, Senior Archivist, ESB Archives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Shannon Scheme was the largest engineering project of its kind in Europe and transformed Irish society forever. It was Ireland’s very first national renewable hydro-electric scheme and has achieved international awards. We are really fortunate that we have an abundance of archival material on the scheme, as well as oral histories from workers, all preserved in our environmentally controlled archives at the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), Dublin, Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a number of years now, we have been delighted to make much of this archival material available on our <a href=\"http://www.esbarchives.ie\">digital platform</a> and to share this incredible social and engineering history with global audiences. The beauty of having such diverse content is that there is something for everyone and we continuously engage with new audiences. We also collaborate with researchers, documentary and film makers and look forward to continuing to reach new audiences across our digital channels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You’ve been busy <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/2020/05/01/ardnacrusha-memories-collecting-your-stories-about-the-shannon-hydro-electric-scheme/\">collecting fascinating stories</a> and objects related to the Shannon Scheme. Why is it important to collect these stories? Can you share one of your favourites?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Peggy Ryan, Docent at the Hunt Museum&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The national significance of the Shannon Scheme since its inception has been well documented. What has been missing is the individual and interpersonal stories of the people that shaped this great project. Stories forge connections among people and convey the culture, values and history that generations can relate to and identify with especially in relation to large-scale projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of my favourite stories is about <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/125/contributions_6c2abf60_aef5_0138_bc8b_6eee0af75a90\">Jack Ryan (1887-1969)</a>, simply because Jack was involved at so many levels of the Shannon Scheme. He was a foreman of a large group of labourers and a drill bore specialist, responsible for setting the explosives before blasting the rock. Jack’s wife Ellen Ryan, neé Heffernan, took in lodgers and ran a shebeen (an unlicensed bar/house selling alcohol) at their home in Aughboy, Clonlara, County Clare. Jack’s son John Joe also worked on the scheme and had a wonderful collection of photos of his time there. You can explore this story, narrated by Jack Ryan’s daughter Marie Dennehy <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/125/contributions_6c2abf60_aef5_0138_bc8b_6eee0af75a90\">on Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n"

How can we explore new narratives and nuance in this area?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr McKayla Stehr, History Instructor, Department of History &amp; Political Science, Fresno City College, California, with a PhD on intersectionality and the Shannon Scheme.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most exciting things about studying race and identity is that historians continue to question the preconceptions and experiences that shaped how people defined themselves and others. While dominant voices constructed racial stereotypes by perpetuating the practice of ‘othering’ in terms of cultural, ethnic, religious, or linguistic differences, these narratives expressed in the press or by officials coexisted with personal stories from people who formed strong bonds with outsiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Shannon Scheme provides historians with an opportunity to explore new narratives about race and identity. Seemingly conflicting perspectives on these topics reveal the error in assuming a singular or stagnant interpretation of Irishness. The presence of German engineers and the absence of British participation at the site echoed conversations that were already underway regarding differences among the Irish workers themselves. Views on race and identity were fluid and contested. The personal stories collected will go a long way in encouraging further conversations about the many layers of Irish identity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Hunt Museum has been very active during COVID-19 restrictions. How will you continue to engage audiences?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jill Cousins, Director of the Hunt Museum</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mantra of digital and open (very Europeana) is one that we are practising as well as preaching at the Hunt Museum. We placed everything that was out of copyright into the public domain two years ago, and made a CC0 dedication with our <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/sybil/\">Sybil Connolly Collection</a>, making it&nbsp;fully available to everyone across the world for use and reuse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We continue to find inventive ways to get our objects digitised in both 2D and 3D such as volunteer groups for 3D digitisation, running workshops with school children and joining in European projects such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-archaeology\">Europeana Archaeology</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages-arma\">Art of Reading in the Middle Ages</a>. The latter will help us become IIIF-compliant. Engagement has also come from adding our collections to <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sybil_Connolly\">WikiCommons</a>, leading to the use of our digital objects in BBC and other programmes. And last, but not least, we have invested in our Education and Social Engagement teams to create online engagement and deliver learning resources that work for schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our plans for next year build on the stories from our <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/2020/05/01/ardnacrusha-memories-collecting-your-stories-about-the-shannon-hydro-electric-scheme/\">collection days</a> and the archival collections of the <a href=\"https://esbarchives.ie/\">ESB Archives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ul.ie/\">University of Limerick</a> and others. We are going to engage contributors and scholars to develop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2FR5aVrngY\">Ardnacrusha Memories</a> into a curricula-based learning resource and add the objects to Wikipedia to enhance knowledge around the cultural and social importance and implication of the Shannon Hydro-Electric Scheme. This gives us at least a couple of means of continuing to engage audiences in Limerick, Ireland and online - so watch this space in 2021!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can watch the recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2FR5aVrngY\">Ardnacrusha Memories Symposium</a> online and discover the objects and stories collected around the Shannon Hydro-Electric Scheme <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?query=ardnacrusha\">through Europeana</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/europe-at-work/new\">share your stories</a> for Europeana’s Europe at Work campaign.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local and national media coverage of the stories shared from the Shannon Scheme&nbsp;included RTÉ Ireland’s national television and radio broadcaster, thanks to Rosemarie Noone, Hunt Museum, and Caragh O’Shea, European Expo.

Exactly which works fall in the public domain is a difficult question to answer since legislation around copyright can be complex, specifically across borders. For European cultural heritage, most of the works that were created by authors that died in the year 1950 are now part of the Public Domain, as the general rule in the European Union is&nbsp; that if an author of a work has died more than 70 years ago, that work becomes part of the Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The copyright status of works isn't static and set in stone, and Public Domain Day is a yearly reminder of its ever-changing nature. The event invites us to re-evaluate the copyright status of works, update their status where needed and encourage other cultural heritage institutions to do the same for their collections. If you see a piece of cultural heritage that you expect to be in the public domain but has a different copyright status, it’s always a good idea to send the institution a friendly message asking them if the copyright tag on a piece of work is still valid, or if it needs updating!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Public Domain Day also gives us the opportunity to call attention to the value of digitising cultural heritage objects, and the opportunities for sharing and re-use of those objects that are created by making public domain cultural heritage available on platforms like Europeana. To celebrate this, we asked members of the Europeana Network Association <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Communicators</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Copyright</a> community Steering Groups to highlight a cultural heritage object in the public domain, and available for everyone through the Europeana website, that they find striking and wanted to share with others. Explore their picks below!</p>\r\n"

This print is part of an album&nbsp; transferred to the Rijksmuseum in 1994 and is now available in the Public Domain. Irish mythology tells of the giant Fionn Mac Cumhaill who built the Giant's Causeway as stepping stones to Scotland, so that he wouldn't get his feet wet. Legend has it Mac Cumhaill also ripped up part of Ireland, which is now Lough Neagh, to throw it at a rival giant, but it missed and it landed in the Irish Sea becoming the Isle of Man, and a pebble from the same becoming Rockall. The Giant's Causeway is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

What would the makers and users of this vessel have made of the limits placed on contact between people in today's Europe? With its multiple handles, this drinking cup neatly allows the viewer to imagine a multitude of hands and their owners sharing a collective drink. This 3D rendering on Europeana makes engaging with this item all the more dynamic during our current era of lockdowns.</p>\r\n"

With the world being as crazy as it is lately, I've been finding solace and peace in artwork that emanates homeliness, hygge, friendship, calm. This 'dog in the Woods' by Weisz-Kubínčan is a perfect example of this. I've been hiking a lot this past year, and by escaping my home office I feel like I can let myself be enveloped by nature, in the same way that the dog in the painting takes on the same colours and lines as the mountains around it. Weisz-Kubínčan was an important Jewish expressionist painter from Slovakia, a brilliant artist whose works emanate mysticism. He perished in a concentration camp near the end of the Second World War. A large swath of his paintings was saved by being stored in a suitcase. An exhibition on Weisz-Kubínčan called <a href=\"https://www.sng.sk/en/exhibitions/2052_artists-heavy-luggage-arnold-peter-weisz-kubincan-1898-1945\">Artist´s (Heavy) Luggage</a>&nbsp;was set up by the Slovak National Gallery in 2019. Maybe this peaceful dog was also one of the works kept safe in that suitcase?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n"

It has been a community effort: Europeana Foundation plays its part, but the work of data providers is crucial too. This requires an appropriate long-term strategy, and a transparent approach to sharing goals and ongoing efforts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2016, EuropeanaTech published a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/best-practices-for-multilingual-access\">whitepaper on best practices for multilingual access</a>, which outlined challenges in this area and presented ideas to tackle them.&nbsp;Under the Europeana DSI project in 2020, we built on this whitepaper to publish a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-multilingual-strategy\">new multilingual strategy and roadmap</a>. This document lays out proposals for handling multilingualism in the context of three general usage scenarios: search, navigate and read. It presents how Europeana's object metadata, full-text content, editorial content and user interface can be enriched with multilingual resources and/or automatically translated in order to provide better user experience, and it proposes a roadmap of experiments and implementations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both the 2016 whitepaper and an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/help-build-multilingual-systems-for-digital-cultural-heritage\">early version of this strategy</a> were made available for feedback and shared with the EuropeanaTech community. The strategy also benefited from discussions during an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/benefits-challenges-and-solutions-for-multilingual-digital-cultural-heritage\">event on multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage</a> organised by the EU Finnish Presidency (see full report <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/benefits-challenges-and-solutions-for-multilingual-digital-cultural-heritage\">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EuropeanaTech Insight and plans for the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, we want to bring these topics to your attention in the context of a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-17-multilinguality\">new issue of EuropeanaTech Insight</a> dedicated to multilingualism in digital cultural heritage. This issue contains three papers that present the problems and key technologies that Europeana and the wider cultural heritage sector should investigate in order to better connect collections and users across languages. This includes recent progress on automatic translation technology, and how this technology can be used for search in cultural heritage repositories. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-17-multilinguality\">Read EuropeanaTech Insight</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming months, we will continue these efforts, focusing on exploring how Europeana can employ automatic translation systems like <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eTranslation\">eTranslation</a>, which benefit from recent progress in AI-powered language technology. A project on automatic translation and Europeana has been recently selected for co-funding in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2020-automated-translation\">2020 CEF Telecom Call on Automated Translation</a>, and we will keep you posted through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro news</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like all systems based on machine learning, the quality of the eTranslation service provided by the European Commission depends on the quality of the data that is used to train it. The more cultural heritage data is made available for its training, the better it will work for our sector, therefore data input is always more than welcome. Our previous <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/help-build-multilingual-systems-for-digital-cultural-heritage\">call for multilingual data for eTranslation</a> remains open, and we invite you to submit proposals to the recently launched <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-europeanatech-challenge-for-europeana-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-datasets\">EuropeanaTech Challenge</a>, which calls for datasets that are appropriate for use in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning research and development (which naturally include efforts in language technology).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To exchange ideas, receive news and network with experts on this topic and research and development in the cultural heritage sector, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">join the EuropeanaTech community</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Translation sprints for the public domain&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/rights/public-domain-usage-guidelines\">Public Domain Usage Guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter</a> are key resources which clarify the importance of the public domain, and can support those advocating in its favour. Towards the end of 2020, we decided that we wanted to make these available to people in more languages, and Europeana‘s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Copyright </a>and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Communicators</a> communities joined forces with <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\">OpenGLAM</a> to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together we organised two translation sprints at the Creative Commons Global Summit (19-24 October) and Europeana 2020 (11-13 November). These gave volunteers a platform to contribute to the translation of core documents relating to the public domain, including the Europeana Public Domain Usage Guidelines and Public Domain Charter, as well as three articles that give an overview of the <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/survey/home\">Open GLAM survey</a> and two articles by Creative Commons: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2019/11/20/reproductions-of-public-domain-works/\">Reproductions of Public Domain Works Should Remain in the Public Domain</a> and <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/08/08/sharing-indigenous-cultural-heritage-online-an-overview-of-glam-policies\">Sharing Indigenous Cultural Heritage Online: An Overview of GLAM Policies</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We started by setting up a set of guidelines for translators and promoting the sprints via social media. At the Creative Commons Summit, we even ran a dedicated session to discuss the goals and documents in focus, then gave translators a couple of days to finalise their translations. To encourage people to participate, we also promised to donate a certain amount of the Copyright and Communicators communities’ budgets to the Arab Image Foundation for every translation we received. The Foundation unfortunately suffered substantial damages due to the devastating explosions at the Beirut port on 4 August 2020.

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started as a classical archaeologist. When I was a child my summers were spent at the biggest archaeological site of the Aegean, Delos, the birthplace of Apollo, so archaeology for me is more than a discipline. As a university student I worked for several years on Delos, Paros and Naxos. After my studies in Greece and Norway, between 1996 and 2000 I was a field archaeologist for the KA Greek Ephorate of antiquities in Greece in Delos, Paros, Samos, Santorini. At the same time I worked as an archaeological guide, licensed by the National School of Greece.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2001 I have been a lecturer at the Norwegian University of Sciences and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, teaching Classical Archaeology, European Archaeology and cultural theory for the Institute of Archaeology and Department of Classics. Since 2006 I have also been Senior Research Librarian at the university library, which is the oldest scientific library in Norway and has <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/ub/special-collections\">special collections</a> of great value for Norwegian national and regional history. In this role I have worked on outreach activities to promote these to our researchers, students and international collaborators, led several digital humanities projects (see <a href=\"http://mubil.no/\">Mubil.no</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ntnu.no/blogger/ub-ark4/about/\">ARK4</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bxmnMJNp6sE\">I manus</a>) and participated in organisational committees and conferences. The projects I have worked on are situated at the intersection of 3D technology and preservation strategies in combination with educational programs for diverse audiences. Find out more on my <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.no/blogger/ub-ark4/2019/11/10/immersive-tourism-for-heritage-and-screen-2d-3d-and-4d/\">blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year I am on leave from the library, working with research support in our <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/brussels\">Brussels office</a> for two years to map the landscape of European partnerships and calls. Our office is currently coordinating a <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/ntnu-european-conference-2020/\">European conference</a> for an international public of 800 attendees on the subject of sustainable goals and the role universities can play.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest challenge in my work at the university library of Trondheim has been to try and keep myself up to date with technology that develops so rapidly. A favourite element of my work is that I constantly meet younger generations as I hold courses for students of archaeology, history, archive science, museology and literature. Every year I also teach a theme on the Masters course <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.no/blogger/ub-ark4/2019/04/25/experts-in-team-the-future-in-service-of-the-past/\">Experts in team</a> with the title ‘The digital dissemination of the past.’ For me this has been an arena of interdisciplinarity and inter-generational creative space that has been valuable for the development of the planning and working landscape of our institution. New partnerships and ideas are born every time I meet students and that is the thrill of working at a higher education institute with experience based learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since beginning to work in Brussels, I have realised that Europeana was one of the main representatives of museums and libraries at a European level, with a mission connected to the protection and management of cultural heritage and representing the sector. I also participated in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-TfvuXV9jnI\">EUvsVIRUS</a> Hackathon with a project that won first prize in the Category challenge. We were told at the Hackathon that they have very few people from the museum sector joining these kinds of events, and through working with Europeana I hope to create more opportunities for cultural heritage professionals to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an archeologist, I have also always thought of our presence in relation to the past and the future. In times of crisis, such as this year’s COVID-19 pandemic, this has become an even greater imperative: how will all these cultural narratives and personal stories be preserved for the future? We need to find new ways to discuss this and create strategies for preserving our digital present which allow all to be included, in a responsible way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am really thrilled to have been elected to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">ENA&nbsp;Members Council</a> from January 2021. I would like to work on inclusion, sustainability, and climate change responsibility. There are a lot of issues that still need resilient efforts to address such as discrimination based on ethnicity, disablity and gender, and challenges around the management and the dissemination of culture. I believe that Europeana can be the place where all can be included and solidarity and creativity can be the way forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would also like to engage in discussions about documentation strategies for today’s digital data. We need forums like Europeana where people of profession but also of dedication create sustainable strategies to structure and disseminate the metadata of archives and special collections. I am already a member of several <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/task-forces\">working groups</a>, and looking forward to getting to know people, hopefully not only digitally, but in person in the future.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Wikipedia is the world’s largest online encyclopaedia, with articles in over 300 languages. In one month, it receives more than 16 billion page views. This ever-growing  knowledge portal is primarily developed, written and edited by volunteers around the world. The Danish Wikipedia has an average of 30 million page views and approximately 3,000 users contributions each month, to old as well as new articles - and Danish is only spoken by around 5.8 million people, which includes toddlers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our project, <em>Wikipedia in School</em>, which we presented in a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/wikipedia-openglam-in-school\">workshop at Europeana 2020</a>, centres on teenagers (13-20) learning to participate in Wikipedia. We want to create teaching materials for use both in school and in cultural institutions. The team behind the project is made up of GLAM professionals, actively working with Wikipedia in Denmark to teach and communicate&nbsp;digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Wikipedia in the GLAM sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why is Wikipedia interesting for the GLAM sector? There is an immense overlap in interests. The GLAM sector has vast amounts of digitised cultural heritage and knowledge which could enrich Wikipedia and its billions of readers. And Wikipedia could gain from the many potential young contributors becoming interested through the sector’s teaching material. In short: GLAMs have open, trusted data that the open encyclopedia needs; Wikipedia has enormous outreach that GLAMs need to be visible and relevant beyond our usual communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Denmark, we have a unique collaboration between Wikimedia Denmark and a number of central GLAM institutions. We have monthly meetings as well as a Facebook group for collaboration and to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and skills (throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, all meetings have been virtual). In this community, we plan large scale mass uploads of digital cultural heritage, help each other to develop new articles, guide newcomers and engage different communities to join and contribute their particular knowledge. We have a common cause: to enhance Wikipedia as a trusted source and increase the reach of GLAM collections and knowledge to the public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Wikipedia in school&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wikipedia is a source through which our common cultural heritage could be spread locally, nationally and globally. However, many young people lack the tools and knowledge needed to start writing on Wikipedia. We believe that an effort to establish an understanding of Wikipedia as a forum for democratic citizenship, where young people can learn source criticism and language development, is required in school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the <em>Wikipedia in School </em>project, we are proposing to teach pupils to navigate Wikipedia, introduce them to the thoughts and ideas behind free and equal information for all, and outline the difference between a solid and a weak source, so that they can start contributing to Wikipedia in potentially any subject. It could be writing about Danish female poets from the 1800s in a literature class or describing mathematical proof in a maths lesson. The difference is that in Wikipedia, their essays are not only read by their teacher, but potentially millions of users. And of course, they will learn to receive feedback as they see corrections and changes in their articles over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to develop a robust framework for this project, we plan to use a shared <a href=\"https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/\">tool for collaboration and management</a>, to make the complexity of students working on different pages easy to manage. We have translated the tool into Danish, and it’s fairly straightforward to make new language versions. We also plan to create a catalogue of approaches and types of activities that allow students to help each other and contribute to Wikipedia in the ways they prefer and find meaningful. These two areas will be the backbone of our education activities so that they can be structured as an easy-to-manage collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, the project will see cultural heritage institutions learn how to share their digitised collections through mass upload from a database, or make a photographical collection a shared and integrated media resource. Institutions will learn how to develop new articles focusing on central themes in their collections, as well as interview people from their institution and upload the audio files as primary sources to Wikipedia. The possibilities are endless!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Wikipedia in School</em> is a non-commercial project initiated by a small group of people and some central cultural institutions in Denmark working with digital heritage, open source and free knowledge. We are currently working on funding the project, and we hope to build a community of interested GLAM and education professionals across Europe that can pursue opportunities for funding together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in joining our international community to exchange thoughts, develop new ideas and strengthen our common goal - to share European cultural heritage and enhance knowledge among our citizens- then please get in touch by joining our <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12491969/\">Linkedin group</a> or emailing Majken Astrup (<a href=\"mailto:majken@my-small-world.com\">majken@my-small-world.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/wikipedia-openglam-in-school\">watch the workshop on Wikipedia and OpenGLAM in school</a> from Europeana 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Pavel Kats looks back on the accomplishments of the Europeana Generic Services project Judaica Europeana 2.0, and discusses how the project consortium has renewed the aggregation of Jewish heritage content to Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>From Judaica Europeana to Judaica Europeana 2.0\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/judaica-europeana\">Judaica Europeana</a>, which ran from 2010 to 2012, was one of Europeana’s first aggregation projects. It aimed to add content from Jewish heritage institutions in Europe, the United States and Israel to Europeana, and in total digitised and uploaded 3.7 million items to the platform.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognising the need to continue the aggregation of Jewish heritage content into Europeana, in 2018 the Jewish Historical Museum (Amsterdam) established the project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/judaica-europeana-2-0\">Judaica Europeana 2.0 </a>under the Europeana Generic Services funding programme. This project aimed to renew the aggregation of Jewish digital heritage materials under the Judaica Europeana aggregator, and consisted of five project partners: the coordinator, the <a href=\"https://jck.nl/en/location/jewish-historical-museum\">Jewish Historical Museum</a> (Amsterdam); the <a href=\"https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/judaica/home_en.html\">Judaica Division of the University Library in Goethe University</a> (Frankfurt); the <a href=\"http://www.aiu.org/en/alliance-israelite-universelle\">Alliance Israelite Universelle</a> (Paris); <a href=\"http://semantika.eu/en-us/\">Semantika</a> (Maribor, Slovenia) and the <a href=\"http://www.michael-culture.eu/\">Michael Culture Association</a> (Bruxelles).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The aggregation platform for Jewish heritage content\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judaica Europeana 2.0 introduced the aggregation platform for Jewish heritage content. This flexible and innovative platform integrates several open-source components to support a wide variety of incoming data sources and map them to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>. All the content originally supplied by Judaica Europeana project has been re-ingested and re-published on Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the re-ingestion of older content, as part of this project a significant amount of new records have been ingested. In total, the project has provided more than <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?query&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Judaica%20Europeana%5C%2FJewish%20Heritage%20Network%22&amp;view=grid&amp;utm_source=old-website&amp;utm_medium=button\">240,000 high-quality metadata and digital heritage records</a> of different items (including books, photographs, historical documents, ephemera) spanning various topics of Jewish history and culture in Europe. A set of new enrichment scenarios for the Judaica domain (most notably, one based on YIVO's <a href=\"https://yivoencyclopedia.org/\">Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe</a>) has been designed and implemented by the project.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the project has established a set of networking and community building activities which aim to sustain not only the aggregated content, but also the network itself as the hub for the development of further Jewish digital heritage initiatives in Europe and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judaica Europeana 2.0 has been a foundational project. It laid the infrastructure for aggregation of content from a wide range of Jewish heritage sources. It also supported semantic enrichment and mapping of this content to semantic standards (such as the Europeana Data Model) and preparing for new tools and apps which aim to engage users with Jewish heritage, culture and history.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the foundations laid by the project, the Judaica Europeana network of content partners is planning to create a number of projects, software services and funders to promote Jewish heritage globally. Some projects are already funded or selected for funding, such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/jewish-history-tours\">Jewish History Tours</a>, a recent Europeana CEF funded project, which will create a network of heritage-based mobile guided tours in several European cities - keep an eye on Europeana Pro news for more information!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get involved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judaica Europeana 2.0 has been just a beginning.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jewishheritagen\"> Follow </a>the Jewish Historical Museum to find out more and work with us to innovate in Jewish cultural heritage. You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-frontiers-for-jewish-digital-heritage\">join New Frontiers for Jewish Digital Heritage</a>, the concluding event of the project today, January 26, and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/jewish-heritage\">explore Jewish heritage content on Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>This post was updated on 18 January 2022 to clarify that the Jewish Historical Museum established and led this project and describe the roles of involved organisations more accurately.\_</strong></em></p>\r\n"

The website is addressed in the first priority, which has an ambition to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-strategy-2020-2025-priority-1-strengthen-the-infrastructure\">strengthen our infrastructure.</a> The strategy for the Europeana website both derives from this ambition and will play a crucial role in delivering it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A framework for engaging our audiences&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main opportunity for Europeana is to grow the services that help institutions to effectively share their collections online. This can be achieved by investing in innovation activities that keep Europeana products and infrastructure aligned with state-of-the-art practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our strategic approach for supporting innovation activities is outlined in Europeana’s framework for user engagement. This framework is a constellation of strategies that center around a shared vision statement outlining aspirations for the website in the next five years. It focuses on the search experience; editorial content; browse experience; user interactions; educational outreach;&nbsp; social media and marketing; and API outreach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After considering what a successful Europeana experience looks like to our stakeholders, we have proposed a new website vision statement (which will continue to be validated and refined):</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>‘By providing cultural heritage enthusiasts, professionals, teachers, and researchers with effective access to European cultural heritage material, we inspire, inform fresh perspectives, and open conversations about our history and culture.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Realising the vision</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The vision statement for the Europeana website ensures that efforts are all looking towards the same future&nbsp;and sets out a focus for growth. In practice, the strategy looks to find innovative ways to both attract visitors and find creative methods to encourage their return. The five strategic priorities are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improving the search (search experience)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visitors indicate that their main reason for visiting the website is to find something specific, and so the effectiveness of search is arguably the most important way to encourage return visitors. To facilitate the discoverability of items, in the coming year we will begin actioning a search improvement plan and review the type of filters we use. To complement our improvements to the quality of search results, we want to offer our visitors extensive filtering options covering everything that they need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lifting the quality of content (editorial and content strategy)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The experience of interacting with the website will only ever be as good as the content&nbsp;that is ultimately available. A review of the type of items that are currently part of Europeana will lead to new recommendations for content providers - who will be asked to help fill collection gaps and meet popular needs for content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Editorial - such as galleries, exhibitions, and blogs - will also continue to showcase the breadth, depth, and quality of Europeana items and play an important role in attracting new visitors and building loyalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engaging with content (user interaction)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">User interaction features - like the ability to create galleries or participate in crowdsourcing efforts - help us to engage our audiences with cultural heritage. By making interactions with Europeana more meaningful, we hope to encourage people to return to explore the website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, last year Europeana released the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/how-to-create-and-use-a-europeana-account\">user galleries feature </a>that enables people to curate a gallery on the website. This was a joint effort with software development partner ThinkCode, who helped implement this functionality. We plan to extend user interaction features like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Navigating content (browse experience)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Browse experiences encourage visitors to follow different paths through Europeana content types, for example from a blog post to an item, to a collection, to search. Paths can improve satisfaction by exposing visitors to interesting materials they might not otherwise discover so easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To facilitate the discoverability of items, we offer visitors multiple entry paths into content by grouping them under relevant topics, relating them for example to their creator and the place where they were created. This year will also see the release of organisation pages which are groups of items shared by an institution. This will provide audiences with a new way to discover items and interact with providers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A multilingual experience (multilingual strategy)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visitors have growing needs and expectations for accessing material in alternative languages, and the plan is to eventually offer a full multilingual experience, for all 24 official languages of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The user interface is already available in 24 European languages, so this new work includes progressively translating language homepages, select editorial, and validating the user experience of the multilingual item and search pages. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/approaches-for-handling-multilingualism-for-digital-cultural-heritage\">Find out more about our approach to handling multilingualism for digital cultural heritage.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A new foundation for growth</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The vision for the Europeana website is of course only one part of the overall engagement framework. We are also excited about the outreach opportunities available through social media channels, as well as educational and API programmes for teachers and developers respectively, all of which are important for amplifying Europeana’s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The redevelopment and replatforming of the Europeana website in 2020 has provided a new foundation for growth. Not only is there now more space to highlight the diversity of European cultural heritage, but there is now the means to improve the website even further. Focusing on the quality of underlying content, better browsing, improved search features, more interactive experiences, and further multilingual support will help the site step up to the next level.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Harmonised aggregation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">24&nbsp;partners from 21&nbsp;European countries took part in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture (ECC)</a> project, which ran from January 2019 to December 2020. The project mapped the current aggregation landscape in Europe through research and surveys, analysed the main challenges and made recommendations for improvement which have been published in a final <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projectpartner/EuropeanaCommonCultureProjectFiles/MS3%20Landscape%20of%20national%20aggregation%20in%20Europe%20Report.pdf\">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project streamlined aggregation processes and strengthened the existing national aggregation network. It facilitated the adoption of common standards and good practices (such as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/metadata\">Europeana Data Model</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and data quality plans) across this network, and supported national aggregators through dedicated expert consultations, a virtual helpdesk and resources on Europeana Pro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ECC also introduced new collaboration mechanisms through peer-to-peer support groups which connected more experienced aggregators with emerging ones to encourage knowledge exchange. As a result, the project helped establish the aggregation infrastructure of five emerging aggregators (Ireland, Serbia, Latvia, Estonia and Croatia), increasing the number of accredited Europeana aggregators to 38.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Capacity building</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ECC delivered a rich programme of training workshops and webinars for national aggregators and the wider cultural heritage sector. The three national workshops (in Sweden, Germany and Austria) and 14 webinars covered a wide range of topics based on the needs and aspirations of cultural heritage institutions, from FAIR data to impact assessment. The programme was well received, with around 500 people in total taking part in the webinars, many of which are available as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars\">online resources</a> on Europeana Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project also researched new, high-potential areas of aggregation development, such as crowdsourcing. The resulting <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projectpartner/EuropeanaCommonCultureProjectFiles/Crowdsourcing%20study%20report.pdf\">study</a> analyses the existing production and infrastructure for crowdsourced digital heritage content and metadata across Europe and makes recommendations to the Europeana Foundation, aggregators and cultural heritage institutions around a possible&nbsp; new aggregation scenario for such content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Infrastructure innovations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ECC developed three applications which support novel approaches to aggregation, improve the speed and quality of the ingestion process and contribute to higher content and metadata quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/innovating-metadata-aggregation-in-europeana-via-linked-data\">The Linked Open Data Aggregator (LODA) pipeline</a>, developed by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) and Dutch Digital Heritage Network (NDE), provides tools for harvesting LOD and converting it from one vocabulary into another. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">Metis Sandbox</a> application, developed by the German National Library (DNB) and Europeana Foundation, allows the processing of sample datasets according to the Europeana workflow and their preview before delivery. The third application, delivered by Trinity College Dublin, is a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-europeana-common-culture-3d-pilot\">lightweight 3D viewer</a> which allows the URL of a 3D resource to be easily integrated into the EDM record and shown on the Europeana website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improved data quality</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project improved&nbsp; 4.4 million records to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">content tier 2</a> and above and provided over 2 million new records to tier 3 and above. In addition, it also enhanced metadata quality, with 85% of all sets provided in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">metadata tier A</a> or above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ECC has contributed over 540,000 new items in tier 3 or above from 162 new institutions in 18 countries to Europeana’s thematic collections. A detailed overview of the enriched datasets is available in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projectpartner/EuropeanaCommonCultureProjectFiles/MS7%20Thematic%20Collections%20improved.pdf\">final report</a>. These collections were highlighted through 76 editorials (including 41 blogs, 34 galleries and 1 exhibition) which showcased 2,064 digitised cultural heritage objects from 385 cultural heritage institutions in 34 countries. The editorials were very well received with over 186,000 visits in total (Europeana Pro and general blog).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Policy advocacy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The success and sustainability of aggregation operations are strongly linked to national and regional policy support. The project developed <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projectpartner/EuropeanaCommonCultureProjectFiles/Recommendations%20for%20a%20European%20Member%20States%20and%20Commission%20supported%20digital%20aggregation%20strategy.pdf\">recommendations</a> for a digital aggregation strategy supported at both European Commission and Member States level. ECC aggregating partners will work together in the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) to build on these recommendations and collaborate with their national representatives in the Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana Expert Group (DCHE) to achieve recognition and endorsement at national and EU level. This will reinforce and lend visibility to the efforts of the Member States to preserve and promote their heritage by going digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative plans to build upon the project’s achievements and good practices in line with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a>. The establishment of a harmonised and coordinated aggregation ecosystem in Europe requires a long-term, sustained effort of all stakeholders. We believe that the Europeana Common Culture project marked a few important milestones in this direction and look forward to continuing to work&nbsp;together with national aggregators, their partner cultural heritage institutions and policy makers to empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation.</p>\r\n"

Priority Areas, Actions and Themes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Research Community is still in its infancy. That is why the following areas were chosen as priority areas by the Steering Group for 2021:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Getting to know our members</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Start building a community</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Start developing a presence in communities of researchers interested in digital humanities and of professionals interested in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In each of these areas, several actions have been identified for the year 2021. We will, for instance, analyse the data gathered from the recent Membership Campaign to gain a better understanding of the members of our community. We will prioritise actions and initiatives, like the participation in non-typical conferences, to reach potential members and make them aware of the community's existence and benefits. We will also start sending a newsletter via the community discussion list, which will have the form of a recap email of what has been published on PRO; it will also invite the community members to share their experiences and to actively participate in the activities planning by expressing their preferences via a quick poll. All of the other actions are grouped under four themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every three months a new theme is introduced. For every theme (1) a curated newsletter is published, (2) a webinar or other online event is organised, and (3) a post-event survey is distributed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The four themes are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>Q1 Impact in research, with a symposium in collaboration with the Impact SG and the Research Advisory Board</li>\r\n    <li>Q2 Understanding Europe’s digital infrastructure(s) for research (EOSC, DARIAH, CLARIN, etc.), with a webinar</li>\r\n    <li>Q3 Building relationships with researchers, with a webinar</li>\r\n    <li>Q4 Generic services, with a training event</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Communication Channels&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Discussion list</strong>: All members of the Research Community are invited to join the Research Community Discussion List.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Research Community Newsletter</strong>: Every three months a curated newsletter is published on the discussion list.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Twitter</strong>: The Europeana Research account on Twitter (@EurResearch) is the main channel used by Europeana to keep the community members informed on a daily basis.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Europeana Research Community Pro Page</strong>: The Research Community Pro Page provides the community with practical information, useful resources and (upcoming) activities.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>ENA Newsletter</strong>: The most relevant achievements and plans of the Research Community can be shared through the ENA Newsletter.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5.

Knowing more about them will help us to more effectively respond to their needs in our activities and function as a supportive and collaborative community. It may help us in our work to attract new members to the community.

This knowledge can be used to evaluate how we welcome people into the Communicators Community and explore ways to improve this. Piloting such a process within our community could support wider onboarding efforts across the ENA, including an upcoming Task Force on the topic. Activities which could contribute to this priority area could include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Creating resources to welcome new community members</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Exploring options for orientation and informal networking events for community (and ENA) members</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Continuing to activate our community and foster connections on social media, and potentially at Europeana 2021</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Supporting the efforts of the ENA’s New Professionals Task Force by looking at ways to make our community welcoming and intelligible to new professionals in the cultural heritage sector.

The community can add value to this discussion by proactively communicating and demonstrating the creative and inspirational ways that digital cultural heritage can be reused when it is openly licensed, through activities which could include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reaching out to the Copyright Community and relevant Foundation colleagues to explore how we can support their work related to open access.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reaching out to the Europeana Aggregators Forum and relevant Foundation colleagues to explore how we can support their work related to data quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Evaluating the #DigitalAperitivo activity at Europeana 2020, to see how similar events could be used to communicate and show the value of openly licenced content.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Creating editorial which demonstrates the value of openly licensed content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Storytelling Task Force</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Community, we aim to support, showcase and communicate the work of the current Task Force ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">Europeana as a powerful platform for storytelling</a>’ which is due to finish in March 2021.

Community Aspiration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The aspirations of the copyright community are to aid practitioners in the cultural heritage sector to navigate copyright in their collections, to help them advocate for adequate institutional support around copyright, and to provide guidance around how to contribute to adequate legal frameworks in their countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This aspiration is based on feedback received from the copyright community at the end of 2019 and throughout 2020, including during online conversations led through a series of webinars, the Fashion Heritage event and the Europeana conference.

While languages, syllabi and curricula may change across the globe, the challenging need to look at the past to understand the present is shared among generations and is universal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the aim of increasing digital cultural data as a trusted primary source,&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/courses/course-v1:Europeana+Culture_EN+2021/about\">Europeana ‘Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ MOOC</a>&nbsp;will empower&nbsp;teachers and educators to use digital technologies, essential to develop learners' 21st century skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This online course will explore the educational potential of digital cultural heritage, improving teachers’ and educators’ understanding so you can efficiently integrate it into your lessons and practices, regardless of the subject. The final goal is to design engaging and deep-learning content for students, museumgoers, or lifelong learners to prepare them as active and responsible citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This MOOC makes use of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/\">digitised collection of cultural heritage</a>, content from the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>, tools like <a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/\">Transcribathon</a> and <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> and other ready-made materials that you can easily integrate into educational activities. The course will also introduce the learning scenario template and guide participants to use it and build their own. Find out more in the video below!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>In 2020, the Europeana Education community ran the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reinventing-beethoven\">#reinventingBeethoven</a>\_educational challenge\_to encourage students to explore Beethoven’s life and work on the 250th anniversay of his birth, and to introduce music as a powerful educational tool in the classroom. While the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-winners-of-reinventingbeethoven-an-educational-challenge\">winning projects</a> have already been announced, we take a closer look at some of the entries to explore how the competition encouraged students and teachers to engage with new tools and digitised cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It looks for educators to be empowered to adopt innovative methods, engage in peer learning and share their experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on this strategic framework and following their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/education-community-work-plan-2020\">2020 work plan</a> objective to share best practices to encourage innovation and new activities, in October last year the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\">Europeana Education community</a> launched <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reinventing-beethoven\">#reinventingBeethoven</a>. This competition invited teachers to introduce Beethoven’s life and work to students and coordinate the creation of a group artwork. It aimed to encourage students’ creativity with cultural heritage resources, and many participants took the opportunity to experiment with digital tools and techniques to create online art, videos and experiences for their entries. Thanks to the efforts of educators and teachers throughout Europe, the challenge proved to be a successful way of fostering innovation in educational activities through cultural heritage. Explore some of these examples below!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Innovative entries&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most exciting entries to the competition was an <a href=\"https://view.genial.ly/5fd27c0490e91a0d05f016cb/vertical-infographic-timeline-narrativa-mision-ludwig-copia\">infographic timeline</a> which brought together the storytelling around Beethoven’s life told in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Kl7XnaNGmsg\">Mission Ludwig</a> project, created by Joaquín Alberto Pagador Becerra and assisted by Veronica Gayango Mena, Angel Manuel Correa Cabezas and Silverio Olmedo Alonso from CEIP Juan XXIII in Zafra (Spain). Using the <a href=\"https://www.genial.ly/\">genial.ly</a> tool and through engaging videos, the group outlines a mystery about Beethoven, which&nbsp; the audience must solve.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mixing traditional teaching techniques and digital tools, the students from Colegio Corazón de María (Gijón, Spain), coordinated by Maria Menendez, created a project called <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Xmm7LY6_7g\">‘Beethoven, the man who was never a child’.</a> In this creation, the students present a video which uses the children's drawings to illustrate Beethoven’s life and his disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the Happy Birthday Beethoven’s project, Elisabetta Nanni from the IC Rovereto Nord (Rovereto, Italy) coordinated her students to create an <a href=\"https://edu.cospaces.io/QNM-YUQ\">interactive exhibition</a> around Beethoven’s life and work using <a href=\"https://edu.cospaces.io/\">CoSpaces Edu</a>, from Microsoft and a <a href=\"https://www.thinglink.com/mediacard/1392928592744153090\">escape room</a> using <a href=\"https://www.thinglink.com/\">Thinglink</a> platform in the Beethoven’s Bonn house.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Inspiring educators as well as students</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were delighted to see that the challenge not only inspired students to engage with the life of Ludwig van Beethoven, but also saw teachers create educational content to further support those taking part. For example, Andreas Galanos, Andreas Roßt and Arjana Blazic, teachers from the eTwinning project Europeana Art 2.0, created a <a href=\"https://typatone.com/m/V8td1PFczC\">Typatone tool</a>&nbsp;where a melody is played as the Ode to Joy&nbsp;poem is scribed in German and then in English. This could be used to help students learn the words to Ode to Joy, sing together, or take part in other creative activities using music and text.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, educator Krešimir Škuljević from Croatia, who participated in #ReinventingBeethoven, wrote a paper titled ‘<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/135m6D03e2wyX8Pi21YINzWCnV3d9GLhR/view?usp=sharing\">School of Life and Life and works</a>’ about the competition. The paper explores how students at Vladimir Nazor elementary school developed their creative artwork for the challenge. Students worked individually on several subjects like history, informatics, music, English language and mathematics to build a connection between these disciplines and the life of Ludwig van Beethoven. They also worked together on learning platforms to learn more about the topic and create videos.The paper explores the objectives, the preparation tasks, the education planning and the tools used in the classroom, for other colleagues, who want to recreate the experience, to benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would like to thank all of the teachers and educators who participated in this challenge for their hard work and efforts to engage their students. We were delighted to see how the competition encouraged students and teachers to explore new digital tools and educational approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to participate in more educational challenges, discover new competitions, create your own initiatives, and network with educators from around Europe, visit the new <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a> and join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\">Europeana Education Community</a>.

                body: "<h3><strong>Why is it important to identify copyright in collection items?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many GLAM institutions see it as a part of their mission to make their collections accessible as widely and freely as possible. Accurately <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/identifying-copyright-in-collection-items\">identifying the copyright status of collection items</a> can support such a mission by ensuring that collections which are in the public domain are correctly marked, so that it’s clear that they can be freely reused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is particularly important as the&nbsp; EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which will have to be implemented in all EU Member States by 7 June 2021, emphasises that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/keeping-digitised-works-in-the-public-domain-how-the-copyright-directive-makes-it-a-reality\">collections that are in the public domain remain in the public domain</a> when made available digitally. Knowing whether something is protected by copyright or not (anymore) is therefore essential for anyone who wants to work with and share their collections in a correct and proper way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A tool to support this process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to identify collection pieces in the public domain while respecting copyright protection for other items, it’s essential to know their rights status. Establishing this can be a very time-consuming task, especially when you need to approach it one piece at a time. This was a challenge that <a href=\"https://meemoo.be/en/meemoo-a-vision-for-the-future-and-the-past\">Meemoo, the Flemish Institute for Archives</a>, aimed to address with our Public Domain Tool, which gives collection managers a helping hand in ascertaining the copyright status of pieces in their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is often lots of information available that can help to partially automate ascertaining the rights status. Consider the date of creation or the year the creator died, for example. The general rule in the European Union is&nbsp; that if an author of a work has died more than 70 years ago, that work is part of the Public Domain. This tool takes a chunk of manual work off your hands by intelligently combining data from a management system with information from Wikidata, giving you faster insights into the copyright status for (at least part of) your collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to use the Public Domain Tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Public Domain Tool was developed in the second half of 2020, and a beta version was launched during Meemoo's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meemoo.be/en/training-and-events/public-domain-day-2021\">public domain day event</a> in Belgium on 2 February 2021.&nbsp;The tool is primarily intended for collection managers from professional museums, archives and heritage bodies, and can freely be used by anyone with a basic knowledge of Dutch. To use the tool:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your starting point is always a CSV export for the part of your collection for which you want to ascertain the copyright status. The more accurate information you already have in your management system, the better the quality of the results you get from the tool.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Public Domain Tool matches the input from your CSV file about makers of your collection pieces with items in Wikidata.

                body: "<h3><strong>A chance to promote your project&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of 2021, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Europeana Research Community</a> now has more than 1,600 members and is the largest community in the Europeana Network Association. We feel it is time to do something special for our impressive membership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the community’s aims is to promote collaborations across the cultural heritage and research sectors, as well as to facilitate knowledge exchange in the broadest sense. We want to give professionals working in these two sectors a new space to present their ongoing experiences or achievements, as long as they have digital cultural heritage as their common thread. At a time when we don’t have the opportunity to meet in person at international conferences, we see an additional value in giving you the floor in a virtual environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we are delighted to launch our first call for videos addressed to the Europeana Research Community. In particular, we are looking for cutting edge projects which use digital resources and tools and which can be an inspiration to others. Whether you are an archivist or an archaeologist, a librarian or a scholar in language and literature studies, a museum curator or an art historian based in Europe, you may want to consider this opportunity to promote a cross-sectoral project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A multimedia approach&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Communicating project activities and results through multimedia is increasingly becoming a must (see, for example, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/imgs/quick-guide_diss-expl_en.pdf\">Quick Guide</a> by the European Commission on Communication, Dissemination and Exploitation). The web has amplified the possibility of getting the attention of&nbsp;professionals who share our interests but also of stakeholders who can support our future research. Video can be a clear and effective way of communicating work and intentions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For this call, we encourage you to take full advantage of the potential of the audiovisual to, for example, show the institution where you work, illustrate the cultural heritage assets at the core of a project, explore a project which bought together the physical and digital, share why digital resources and tools are relevant to your objectives, or explain how funding opportunities and technologies have made them feasible. Multilingualism matters to us, so feel free to speak your native language in the video and provide English subtitles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results of this call will inaugurate the Europeana Research Community Series, as a collection of videos showcasing fresh ways of enhancing cultural heritage through research, particularly in the fields of Social Sciences and Humanities, up to the so-called Digital Humanities’ expanding territories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Submit a proposal for a video</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to create a video please read the guidelines at the end of this post and submit a proposal through the link below. You will need to provide some basic information, as well as describe your project, explain why you think it is relevant to the Europeana Research Community, and specify what you would like to show in the video. Please also add relevant links - links to project-related webpages and to videos you/your institution have already made would be particularly helpful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposals will be assessed by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Europeana Research Community Steering Group</a> on a rolling basis, and successful applicants will be required to provide the video and an introductory text within two months after they are notified that their proposal has been accepted. We are making a small budget available to the proposals submitted before 31 March 2021. If your institution isn’t equipped to support you in making a high-quality video, you can benefit from up to €300 for the uses detailed in the guidelines below. Approximately eight selected proposals will receive funding. Europeana will transfer the amount requested after the acceptance of the video proposal, upon the receipt of an invoice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your video should not exceed five minutes; please be aware that videos up to two minutes are the most effective on social media. You need to be a member of the Research Community to participate in this call. If you aren’t yet, it is free and easy to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">join the community</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

This includes images, music, video, animation, etc. The main reason is that, even if you have a license to use the content, the use of the licensed content is limited to the use you declare when buying the license and your publication, and we may not be allowed to publish the content without buying a license too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Consent forms</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interviewing people? Are you working on the video as a team? Then make sure that everyone involved knows how to content will be published and might be used. In other words: make sure that they know and agree to the fact that it will be published under an open license and that reuse will be encouraged. We suggest the use of consent forms for participants outside your organisation. Are you working with people under 18? Then make sure you get permission from their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Audio quality</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We expect your audio to be of good quality. This goes for voice overs, interviews and background music. The audio should be loud enough without background noise(s). Music should not conflict with interviews and/or voice overs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Video quality</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your video should be at least in Full HD (1920 * 1080 pixels). 4K is not necessary, but if you have the possibility to produce in 4K we highly encourage it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Editing and color correction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your video should be edited to cover your core messages and include basic color correction that reflects natural colours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Language and subtitles</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All videos submitted should be subtitled. Your video does not have to be in English, but if you choose to make your video in your own language, then English subtitles are required. We encourage you to include captions (subtitles in your own language) too. Please export your video in multiple ways: without subtitles and with the subtitle files as separate .srt files and with the subtitles “baked in” the video. You can do this for each language and/or with multiple languages in the same video.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Time</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Your video should be at least 90 seconds and shorter than five minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Codec</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We need an .mp4 at least. We encourage sharing higher quality video files (uncompressed, for example Prores422 LT).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future proofing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you making a video that might need an update in the (near) future? Then make sure to archive your project in such a way that an update is easy to make. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj51kSjMe74\">This video</a> gives some practical guidelines in organising video assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Publication platforms and moment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your video will be published on Europeana channels. You can also publish it to your own video platforms if you want to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support needed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can request funding for this if you don’t have the equipment, skills or time to produce this. Funding can be used for example for:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Translation for the subtitles in English</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Voice over artists</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Simple animation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Checking scripts</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Editing of a video, for example putting slides and a voice over together</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Subtitles and captions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These services can be found in many different levels of quality and relating prices. A few websites that might be worth your time to check for these services are fiverr.com and PeoplePerHour.com for voice overs, animation and editing. Descript can be used for editing and subtitles and Rev.com for subtitles and captions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below is an example of a budget breakdown for a production for a video of 3 minutes where you have supplied video content, images and/or slides:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Voice over through Fiverr.com with proofreading and adjustments: €50,-</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Editing of video through Fiverr.com (standard): €100,-</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Subtitles (language of video): €7 per minute = €21,-</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Subtitles (language of video translated to English subtitles) through Rev.com: €7 per minute = €21,-</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Total budget: €192</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b><i>This guidance was updated on 19/12/21 to note that all videos must be subtitled.&nbsp;</i></b></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Tell us about your role.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started working at the German Digital Library (DDB) in 2013, coming into close contact with the various aspects of a cultural platform which is in many ways similar to Europeana: metadata, workflows, communication within a large network, diverse partners from various cultural sectors&nbsp; - all with a common feature of making cultural heritage available for all. It is a very exciting environment and I can say I learn something new almost every day, even now, after eight years! There is a lot of creativity, a lot of will and dedication, and a lot of challenges, both big and small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I came into contact with Europeana through this role, but also when I started reusing digital objects for Europeana for my hobby – art collages. One might say that my relationship with Europeana has two dimensions – both providing data and reusing it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently managing the project ‘Improving the quality of the metadata and the processes in the German Digital Library’. It is a very exciting project because it combines various aspects of the DDB: metadata quality and improvement, increasing the efficacy of processes, and also standardisation and communication. It is an intersectional project - it takes work across the whole process of delivery into consideration, dives into the quality of input and output data, and considers various factors that influence the whole lifecycle of metadata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last two years I have been working in this direction with Europeana and my colleagues in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture project</a>: we have been developing an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">aggregation prototype</a> that would make the data delivery more efficient and working with data providers towards improving content and metadata quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One key challenge is 'heterogeneity'! We have heterogeneous data, coming from heterogeneous partners, we use a multitude of heterogeneous tools to process the data in various formats and we have a heterogeneous public. Also communication across such an intricate network is always a challenge. Our direct work colleagues involve at least 20 institutions. However, this is also a valuable potential, because the spectrum of skills and experiences across the network is extremely large!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe in Europeana and its ideals! I believe that European culture has much digital potential that still needs to be brought to light – and used. We all know there is still much work to be done to strengthen the aggregation infrastructure, work towards improving data quality, and support (especially small) institutions that need help and guidance in the digital world. And use all this in order to transform the world with – digital – culture! It is a crucial role and especially now, in times that are so trying for all of us, the importance of the digital world is bigger than ever. We have the chance to give it a new direction, a strong push, and continue to embody the pioneer spirit that brought Europeana to life!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We live in a transformational environment, because a crisis, especially one of these dimensions, will change us as society. I think – like most of us do - that the digital perspective will offer new dimensions. This is a unique moment for us to jump on the wagon of change and work hard to close the digital divide - because digital is essential now. Looking back, I want to reflect on the European Union’s 2011 call for a ‘New Renaissance’ which brought us Europeana. I think ten years since this, it is time for a second wave. Let those synergies flow! Channeling them into pan-European infrastructure projects – this is where I see myself involved. We can’t beat heterogeneity, and we must not even try, because there is beauty in disharmony - but we can make it work for us.</p>\r\n"

While some join because of their love for copyright, many do so to find answers, because copyright remains at times a challenging issue for those working in cultural heritage - and beyond!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#steering-group\">Copyright Community Steering Group</a>, we believe there is very valuable knowledge within this community, and probably many common challenges. There are people who might have found solutions to the problems that others are facing. There are materials, guidelines, best practice or case studies produced in one country which could turn out to be the inspiration that others need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through a set of regular and informal calls, we want to connect these dots and explore a different approach to supporting the community. We know there are many resources out there, but for some of the questions, a conversation can be much more helpful. When it comes to such a challenging topic, where sometimes there is no right answer, a bit of support can only do us good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How it will work</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will set up a call every six weeks. The conversations will be informal, and will not be recorded. The aim is to help each other by taking advantage of being part of such a broad network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can come with any type of questions that are relevant to you, from the very specific to very broad, or even philosophical questions and general wonderings, as long as it is copyright and open access related.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On each call, a couple members of the Copyright Community Steering Group, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/andrea-wallace\">Andrea</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ellen-euler\">Ellen</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fred-saunderson\">Fred</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/karin-glasemann\">Karin</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marina-markellou\">Marina</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/evelin-heidel\">Scann</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ariadna-matas\">Ariadna</a>, will be there to moderate the discussions and share their thoughts, point you to relevant documentation or showcase examples. Others in the call might also have advice, and if not, we can try to find an answer together. In any case, please note that this will by no means constitute any legal advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From time to time, we might have guest speakers in the calls, showcasing a specific approach or case study, but want to avoid turning this into a formal webinar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These informal calls are a format we are not familiar with just yet. We will explore how the calls develop, see if they are helpful, and adapt them as we go. Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:copyright@europeana.eu\">contact us</a>&nbsp;with your thoughts. In any case, we see it as a valuable opportunity to establish a two-way communication among the community, and to support each other, that we do not want to miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have come up with a tentative schedule, and reminders will be sent via the Copyright Community Listserv and shared on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaIPR\">Twitter account</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">25 February at 13h CET.

In early 2020, it was written into the Europeana Initiative’s mission, which became to ‘empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation’. At a time of global crisis, working digitally has proved more important than ever before, and we set out to work with our partners and network members to understand what it meant to them in practice. Now, we have a shared working definition of digital transformation for the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>‘Digital transformation’ is a term that is used in different ways by different people in different sectors. We have worked with our peers, partners and Europeana Network Association members to agree a common working definition that is relevant to the cultural heritage sector and our stakeholders. We will use the definition to help shape our future strategies and priorities, so that a cultural heritage sector powered by digital can contribute to a Europe powered by culture. The definition will help us meet the needs of the sector, guide how we think about our impact and shape how we measure our success and, ultimately, the progress of the digital transformation of the sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The work on the definition builds on the outcomes of the series of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">sense-making workshops</a> run by Michael Peter Edson and Jasper Visser in the summer of 2020 that helped us identify and shape a capacity-building framework based on the needs of the sector. To complement this, we asked Culture24 to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-digital-transformation-agenda-and-glams-culture24-findings-and-outcomes\">explore</a> what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions. Their findings, and a series of consultative workshops with the Europeana Network Association Members’ Council and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, have fed into the process of defining our central term - ‘digital transformation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital transformation - a definition for the cultural heritage sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Digital transformation is both the process and the result of using digital technology to transform how an organisation operates and delivers value. It helps an organisation to thrive, fulfil its mission and meet the needs of its stakeholders. It enables cultural heritage institutions to contribute to the transformation of a sector powered by digital and a Europe powered by culture.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our work, our sector, indeed our world, is not static. And neither is our definition of digital transformation. We will use it as our guiding principle and we expect to keep revisiting it, adapting it, making sure that it is fit to serve the cultural heritage sector. We’ll keep thinking about how the definition - and our capacity-building framework - changes as the digital landscape and the work of our heritage institutions evolves over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A longer, fuller version of the definition is available on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity#step-2-defining-digital-transformation\">’Building digital capacity’ page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’d like to thank everyone who has taken the time to feed into the process of creating this definition, including the many representatives of the Europeana Network Association Members’ Council and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re interested in our work to develop a capacity-building framework, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=70e7d06bec\">sign-up</a> for updates and join our forthcoming <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-cafe\">Europeana Café</a> on capacity building.</p>\r\n"

Now that very same office has made a permanent nest in our homes and over these long months, we have had to learn how to embrace enforced home working and a total melding of our living time and space. Lockdown sometimes feels interminable. Days slip into evenings and workdays collide with weekends. Commuting from the bedroom to the computer desk still doesn’t quite feel like a real morning where home and work would have been separated by some sort of physical journey, and carrying the coffee to the home desk is not the same as gathering around the coffee maker in the office.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The unfurling of time sometimes seems unreal, and after all these long months it can sometimes feel like we are on a train with no planned stops in sight and no final destination. As the new year stumbled in, and - sadly, without much improvement so far - I have had the pleasure, and honour of stepping up to Chair the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a>. Taking on these challenging responsibilities has given me an opportunity to pause and rethink what it means for our community and how we can continue to work together and support each other over the months to come.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This has made me consider how we use our time and I would like to suggest some pragmatic steps to find new ways of thinking about how we share our workload together. We are at risk of facing burnout, and unless we set up some mindful boundaries to be able to manage our multiple responsibilities to self, family, community and our work, things are not going to get any easier.&nbsp;Making these kinds of changes can’t be done alone as we are (luckily) still linked into our work environment; albeit remotely. Any decision has to be a group decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Managing our workload together</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been discussing these principles with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> and at our recent meeting we all made a commitment to function, as a group with a new informal structure in place. We agreed to remain within a fixed eight hour work routine where meetings no longer encroach on family or leisure time.&nbsp;Hopefully we will manage to restrain ourselves emailing each other after hours or over weekends.&nbsp;Essentially this means being kind to one another and respecting private time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Underlying this principle is a new social contract. No one will penalize you, for example, if you send off an email after hours or on the weekend, but, at the same time, don’t expect an answer before Monday.&nbsp; We have also introduced the notion of time-sharing, where members of the board take on responsibilities with a co-board-member on specific tasks so that when time resources are challenged there will always be a partner available to rely on. As the board took up these principles, and I hope that&nbsp;if we&nbsp;as a small group&nbsp;can manage to uphold them, we can then suggest something similar to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>&nbsp;to see whether this experiment in time is as viable with the Council’s responsibilities as the communities continue with their valuable and intense work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Mindful boundaries</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be kind to your colleagues - you may not recognise their mental exhaustion in the tiny Zoom window where you are viewing them. The appearances of kids jumping on to laps and in out of the frame might be a bit of a giveaway, but the unexpected cameo performance of flatmates moving unwittingly into the screen is a glimpse into the outtakes of our lives and the havoc we struggle so hard to conceal in the Zoom window. At the same time we share windows into the emptiness of home lockdown - we have become prisoners in our own homes and until we can get back to our lives again, home can be a very lonely place. We have just gone through a terrible year and we are not out of it yet. So think about taking up these mindful principles and share them when, wherever and with whoever you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Hebrew we say Shabbat Shalom - have a peaceful sabbath. So however you and your colleagues define your weekend, make sure it is a restful one. Bring back the Sabbath break - it is not necessarily a religious devotion but a useful separation of work and no work in order to refresh emotional energies and get a reset for the new week.&nbsp; Clearly, this is a group decision and not one we can take alone. So, introduce the mindful boundaries principle to your colleagues, your team, your boss, set&nbsp;Ctrl+Alt+Del and make a new start.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Setting out and setting up&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the wealth of activity within the Europeana Initiative, choosing where to focus and conduct our impact assessments was not easy. We tried to find a good balance across the Initiative’s activities in terms of partners, communities and format. We also had to think practically - where could we get enough data within the timeframe - and materially - where do we anticipate substantial impact to occur?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the end, we looked at the impact of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europeana-network-association\">Europeana Network Association membership</a>, and considered participatory initiatives like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-enrich-europeana-transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a> (Enrich Europeana Generic Services project) and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europe-at-work\">Europe at Work campaign</a>. We looked into the impact of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> and the Europeana Initiative on the promotion and adoption of IIIF within Europe, and the social return on investment of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-case-study-europeana-in-your-classroom-mooc\">Europeana Education MOOCs</a>. We investigated capacity development initiatives like our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-national-workshops\">National Workshops programme</a> with our aggregator partners, our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-digital-programming-series\">digital programming</a>&nbsp;(webinars and online workshops) and the biannual <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-presidency-events\">European presidency events</a>. Impact assessments of the Europeana annual conferences in 2019 and 2020 will also be published shortly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How we did it</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We used a mixed methods approach to assess the economic, social, innovation and organisational impact of Europeana’s services. Each case study has its own discrete approach and methodology; some are ‘light-touch’ and others are more in-depth because we had more opportunity and flexibility in terms of data collection and methods. Some incorporate the views of multiple stakeholders, some just one main stakeholder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The research was collaborative from the outset. Collaboration, combined with the enthusiasm of colleagues for contributing to it, suggests that impact methodology is becoming more embedded in processes and mindsets. It doesn’t mean our processes are perfect: we are still learning and improving. Yet embedding impact in how we design and deliver our work is already giving us tangible value. Thanks to our findings, we have more data to support our reporting to the European Commission and we are learning and creating better events and programmes for the sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we learned</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of the case studies offers learning about the specific service, tool or event that they examined, and we encourage you to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-case-studies\">read the individual reports and their summary pages</a>. However, we also drew out some high-level insights that we’d like to share. We learned that:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We need to think holistically about impact. Although we know, for example, about the social return on investment of our Europeana Education MOOCs, we still need to understand what value the knowledge the educators gained had for the quality of their students’ education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana has added value when addressing socially relevant themes. We know from our Impact Assessment of Europeana 2019 that the fact we were proactively working to minimise negative environmental impact was important to conference attendees. But whether it’s the diverse stories we want to tell through our editorial, or our participatory campaigns like Europeana Migration or Europe at Work, digital heritage is most relevant and can have the greatest impact when it speaks to the language - and the challenges - of contemporary life.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana creates impact as a convenor of sector professionals. The strongest outcomes of our annual conferences are the networks they create. While harder to measure, we think that this can create impact through the generation of new knowledge through collaborative projects or increased sustainability of the sector through levered funding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Depth of experience leads to stronger impact. In initiatives like Transcribathon, increased depth of connection and interaction with the tool is likely to lead to those longer-term outcomes we want to see. Similarly, with our Network, we need to encourage greater depth of involvement and experience.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Barriers to digital transformation cannot be solved by Europeana alone: it’s about partnership and collaboration. This was also one of the strongest themes that emerged from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-digital-capacity-sense-making-findings-and-outcomes\">sense-making workshops</a> held last summer. How do we convene the sector to co-create, learn together, support each other, and benefit from economies of scale, in order to deliver impact in a period of accelerated digital transformation?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">(Digital) change takes time. IIIF is a huge innovation but its implementation takes a lot of time (and this has implications for impact assessment, too). The digital transformation of the sector won’t happen overnight, and we need to start thinking now about how to support, monitor and measure this change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where do we go from here?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These case studies, and the ones that follow, are designed to be replicable models for others to build and improve on. They document our learning and help us grow the data to help us answer the question, ‘what is the value of digital cultural heritage?’. The challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in measuring their impact are likely to be even more acute as a result of the current COVID-19 crisis. There is even more urgency to understand and measure the value of cultural heritage in order to advocate for continued financial, political and social support. Furthermore, we need to continue to experiment, learn and innovate in order to harness the full impact that digitisation and digitalisation - in short, digital transformation - can have on a cultural heritage instution’s mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our Impact Community <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-the-impact-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-digital-transformation-join-our-webinar-series\">webinar series</a> we are seeing a need for practical training in impact assessment. To meet this, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-lite\">Impact Lite</a> Task Force is thinking about ways to turn observers of impact assessments into practitioners. Training materials will be released as part of their work and also as part of the continued development of the Europeana Impact Playbook. Phase three of the Playbook is due to be published in the Autumn of 2021, and further materials to support Phase two, including a standardised question bank, will soon be available. Ongoing work to develop a Europeana Initiative Theory of Change will further guide focus on key areas where we want to demonstrate impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can find each report on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-case-studies\">Impact case studies page on Europeana Pro</a>. Take a look through the summaries,&nbsp;see if anything strikes you, and then delve into the main report. We want you to learn from and build on the approach that we are taking and we want to hear about your experiences, too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the midst of social justice action, a global health emergency, the climate catastrophe and ongoing political upheaval, cultural heritage has an important role to play and we want to make sure the Impact Playbook is there to support and catalyse change.

                body: "<p>The goal of this assessment was to document impact relating to IIIF documentation, in order to guide the strategy of EuropeanaTech as an Europeana Network Association (ENA) community. This Impact Assessment adds value to the new EuropeanaTech IIIF Working Group and the work of EuropeanaTech by offering an insight into its contribution to a valuable resource for the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the initial stages of this research, we investigated if <a href=\"https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/outcome_harvesting\">Outcome Harvesting</a> would be an appropriate tool to use. This is a methodology that is increasingly used in complex, multi-stakeholder activity where pre-defined objectives are not in place. Guided by external impact consultants Sinzer powered by Grant Thorton and a specialist in this methodology, we developed a research question and a data collection plan - the first known application of the methodology in the cultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the methodology surfaced only two outcomes which we were unable to substantiate. This does not mean that the methodology is not useful,&nbsp; but does suggest that it has its limitations in a complex context with a very slow pace of change and many other influencing factors. Further research, and a longer-term perspective, is needed to adequately address the research question. Although the Outcome Harvesting methodology was ultimately not suitable for investigating change in this context, the need for the identification of tangible outcomes and the verification of these outcomes with stakeholders is its strength.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help answer our research question, we asked other interview questions to the consulted stakeholders, and coded the results in terms of what they told us in response to the overarching research question, which was: ‘what was EuropeanaTech’s and the wider Europeana Initiative’s role in encouraging the implementation of the IIIF framework between 2015 and 2020?’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The following themes emerged through the interview programme:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Without the work of the EuropeanaTech Community, there would be no IIIF data on the Europeana website. Yet we lack the data that would help us investigate if and how EuropeanaTech contributed to an increase in IIIF-compliant data on Europeana. The lack of data is the result of the time it takes to make new or to adapt existing technical infrastructures. This timeframe also makes attributing one factor or trigger of change very difficult.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech and Europeana increased the visibility of IIIF amongst the cultural heritage community, and increased the momentum around the topic. Europeana led by example in adopting IIIF, and is seen as a trusted peer. Its actions should be seen in the context of a general zeitgeist around technological development, where change becomes easier when there are multiple sources and actors encouraging you to adopt a standard or tool.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech facilitates exchange between Europeana and cultural heritage institutions and between cultural heritage and tech professionals. The Europeana IIIF group meetings have the highest attendance of all of the online IIIF meetings. Europeana’s connections to European cultural heritage institutions was identified by one IIIF representative as the biggest value of the collaboration. However, the connection to and interaction with national aggregators was not as strong as it could or should be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The EuropeanaTech brand is respected. EuropeanaTech’s value lies in addressing tech developments not only relevant to Europeana but providing a valuable space for conversations around the sector’s tech development more generally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech and IIIF events emerged in the interviews as being vital for the widespread ‘exposure’ of the European heritage sector to IIIF. They were described as ‘energising’ to the community. EuropeanaTech widened participation beyond national institutions in the UK and Europe to a wider group of cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech and Europeana’s early adoption and promotion of IIIF provided a space for experimentation and technical advancement. Europeana is described as being more than a partner that displayed content using IIIF: it supported experimentation and development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have learned about the complexity of understanding change in this area, and about strengths and weaknesses of the Outcome Harvesting methodology. It is difficult to measure change when technological change and decision-making can be slow-moving. Furthermore, it was a challenge to isolate the degree to which EuropeanaTech and Europeana may have contributed to an outcome in isolation from, or even combined with, the activity of others. In addition, it was difficult for the interviewees to isolate specific cases relating to the adoption of IIIF as a result of Europeana’s ‘distance’ from the CHIs that provide data to it through an aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For Europeana and the EuropeanaTech community:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech should continue to showcase the work of IIIF in Europe and act as a conduit of information from the wider IIIF community to European cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">As part of ongoing work into mapping case studies to describe the process and value of providing content into Europeana, more focus should be paid to describing, and thus understanding, the varied factors that can progress and hinder decision-making and action in a cultural heritage institution. Case studies would be valuable in this regard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Communication and reporting should be explicit in its narration of identified short-term outcomes and value generated, moving from a vague narration of activity towards an assessment of how it delivered against its objectives. This demands a more critical narrative approach. In the longer term, it also increases the evidence base should future evidence or document reviews be conducted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For further research:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Further research is needed to answer the research question. This requires the investment of more resources and a longer-term perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Using the themes emerging from the interviews, conduct a survey to see if these views are representative of the wider EuropeanaTech community.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We see that there is a potential demonstrable impact for cultural heritage institutions at a direct and indirect level as a result of EuropeanaTech and Europeana Foundation’s activity. However, the Outcome Harvest raises the question of ‘so what?’, requiring us to investigate what the additional impact of implementing IIIF on an institution’s collections might be. This is an area for further research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report was reviewed by almost all interviewees. The report, noting the complexity of the context under investigation, benefited from the interpretation and perspective of the interviewees. This research is designed to inform the longer-term strategic development of EuropeanaTech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The preparations for the Europeana Network Association (ENA or the Network) impact assessment and satisfaction survey were initiated in Autumn 2019, with the aim to measure and report the level of satisfaction of the ENA members with services that the Network offers as a KPI under DSI4. In March 2020, the ENA Members Council and Management Board reviewed and provided feedback on the survey format and content. Based on their feedback, the survey was further refined and simplified. However, due to the COVID-19 crisis, an agreement was reached to postpone the research until June 2020, when we sent a digital questionnaire to all registered Network members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The questionnaire asked questions related to impact, drawing on a change pathway developed for this exercise. It also asked questions relating to Network members’ satisfaction. Both components were kept quite short to encourage completed responses. 308 Network members responded to the survey, representing an estimated response rate of 10.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The following themes emerged from this research:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Network provides its members with knowledge useful for their profession. 74% of Network members agree or strongly agree that the Network provides access to knowledge about trends and good practice. We see that most respondents report that the Network is a little bit important (32%) or moderately important for their work (30%). 14% of respondents suggest that Network membership has a great deal of importance for their daily work (most prevalent among those who have been members for more than six years), and only a small number of respondents suggest that it has no value for them (most likely for those who have been members for between 2 - 4 years).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The information shared with the Network reaches beyond its members. We learn that 64% of Network members encourage others to explore Europeana services and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Network provides an opportunity for professionals to improve their professional digital heritage practice and knowledge. 11% of respondents suggested that the Network provides opportunities to shape and drive policy in digital cultural heritage. 11% of Network members also report a link between membership and applications for project funding. Some respondents directly reference funded projects or levered funding. This suggests that there is a relatively small but discernible link between Network membership and the leverage of funding for activity in digital cultural heritage. We can say, then, that the Network helps to support the overall sustainability and growth of the sector, but further research is necessary to quantify what the scale of contribution might be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Only 16% of respondents suggested that an outcome of Network membership was the opportunity to get more involved in the Europeana ecosystem. Similarly, when we surveyed whether Network members felt that the Network provided access to opportunities and events, only 58% agreed or strongly agreed. Similarly, there is a higher response to the ‘neither agree nor disagree’ choice, suggesting that the sharing of opportunities and events is an area that could be improved for Network members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Network supports the development of a more collaborative and connected sector thanks to information flow and network development. 40% of Network members encourage others to join the Network, and we learn from the Net Promoter Score (NPS) that 48% of respondents can be considered ‘promoters’ of the Network and 15% are detractors. 50% follow Europeana on social media. 70% of Network members agree or strongly agree that the Network facilitates access to other sector professionals. This network development is strengthened by the fact that the longer someone is a Network member, the more likely they are to go to the main annual Europeana conference (formerly the AGM), at which a separate impact assessment found that network development was the strongest outcome. Yet when we looked at this more closely by asking Network members to report their personal experience of membership, only 34% of Network members suggested that the extension of their personal network was one of the most important outcomes of Network membership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Network Association provides a structure through which the majority of members feel connected to other sector professionals. It keeps them up to date with sector knowledge and best practice. Though the Network is considered positively to provide access to other professionals, members do not seem to feel that network development, or the opportunity to collaborate with others, is as strong an outcome as others, such as gaining knowledge about best practice or learning something that they can apply in their work. That this content is designed to relate to best practice and innovation in digital cultural heritage, shows that the Network is positively contributing towards its goal of improving the quality of digital heritage, and thereby supporting the digital transformation of the heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The findings could be strengthened if combined with an interview programme where a representative cohort of Network members are surveyed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Future impact assessment could focus on the impact of specific changes or innovations in the Network or how it is run, in order to capture impact for Network members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This report shows initial findings that suggest a link between the Network and the levering of funding into digital cultural heritage, but more research is needed to understand the scale of this within the Network and to interrogate to what extent this is linked to Network membership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It would be valuable to more clearly differentiate between what is considered as active/super-active and inactive/passive membership. It would be interesting to ascertain how outcomes change between members who are reportedly more active in the Network, compared to those who are inactive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report was shared with the ENA Members Council for their perspectives to help validate the interpretation and assumptions made in the report. The ENA Membership working group will begin to explore the membership potential and benefits, and to find new ways to actively involve ENA members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.</p>\r\n"

Digital questionnaires were shared with those members of the public who contributed their stories and/or objects to the campaign, though in the end this was a very small sample. The findings attempt to consider the outcomes for both of these stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The findings can be summarised as follows:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europe at Work encouraged a sense of a European connection for participating hosts and those contributing their stories (both online and at events).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For the collection day hosts, the Europe-wide campaign brought local objects and stories to new, international audiences; created connections to partners across Europe; and for some, appeared to improve the standing or reputation of the host organisation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europe at Work collection days do not appear to have changed how the general public engage with or think about heritage institutions or digital cultural heritage, in the short-term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europe at Work strengthened collection day hosts’ relationships with existing audiences. Relationships were also strengthened with local partners. It does not seem to have generated connections with new audiences.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The campaign resulted in good relationships between Europeana Foundation staff and initiative, and the collection day hosts. Hosts seem likely to take part in future activity and be active in the wider Europeana network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The general public value being able to preserve their stories, and the collection day hosts interviewed report that they enjoyed being able to connect with audiences at this level of depth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Collection days support ongoing processes of digital change by reinforcing the value of being more digital or inspiring further digitisation. Change is more pronounced in cultural heritage organisations with a lower stage of digital maturity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Collection day hosts are likely to use the skills they gained and the approach of the collection day in future work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There was an element of value found in how the campaign increased the scale of a heritage institution’s collection, but this did not come through strongly.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The theme of a campaign is important in terms of who is attracted to participate, and it is also a key motivation for the heritage organisation to participate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We see that the participating institutions are mostly undergoing digital transformation to a greater or lesser degree. We predict that campaigns like Europe at Work could help to encourage collection day hosts to include digital heritage in future participatory events, and in general, to encourage and support increased activity in the digital heritage field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European aspect of the campaign had value on a number of levels for the collection day hosts, and it also supported those who contributed their data to see their stories through an alternative, international lens. We are unable to judge to what extent this encouraged a sense of a European identity in the long-term but we suggest that this is a positive step in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We see that it is likely that the participating collection day hosts become more regular participants in Europeana activity, and this suggests that participatory campaigns are effective ways to widen a network of organisations with whom Europeana can work with on a first-hand basis, in addition to the relationships nurtured by aggregators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These findings have been designed to contribute to Europeana’s desire to continually improve the impact of its participatory campaigns. The approach used is more light-touch than used previously, for example in the Migration campaign, so this report also acts as an example of the type of impact assessment model that can be applied to activity in a less intensive and resource-demanding way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The draft report was shared with interviewees prior to publication for their validation, that is, to ensure that the data had been interpreted correctly. A few interviewees responded, and feedback was positive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

We assessed the outcomes experienced by participants, primarily through pre- and post-workshop questionnaires and questionnaires that were sent at least six months after the workshop. We compared data from eight different workshops in 2018 and 2019. Regrettably, as a result of COVID-19 and insufficient response rates to one survey, we have been unable to collect further longitudinal data and insights from 2019 workshop participants, and the overall sample from 2018 is very small. We complemented our research by interviewing a participant of one of the 2018 national workshops, a national aggregator and the Europeana Foundation member of staff responsible for national workshops.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">National workshops support digital transformation to some degree. The workshops under review mainly reach an audience of those who are aware of Europeana but who are not part of the Europeana ecosystem and who do not provide data to Europeana. Participants learn both about Europeana’s mission and goals and its frameworks and standards. This knowledge could be, and in many cases, has been, applied practically in a cultural heritage institution’s work. We see that as a result of attending a national workshop, participants take some action to improve their data. In the Lithuanian case, the data is visibly improved (though the national workshop is only one of a number of influences that led to this).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The national workshops do not seem to support attendees to become more involved in the Europeana initiative, e.g. few attendees appear to join the Europeana Network Association. Some participants were encouraged to take part in Europeana projects, but to catalyse a feeling of inclusion as part of a bigger community around digital cultural heritage, more emphasis on achieving this outcome is necessary, as well as understanding what this looks like when it happens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We see a need for more practical training on areas relating to the publication of digital heritage. We can see other barriers to change in terms of where Europeana can contribute directly and indirectly. Europeana is not able to directly help with additional funding, increasing capacity and entrenched mindsets, but by identifying direct areas where Europeana can help (e.g. advocacy and the development of case studies) it may be better able to address some of these barriers. Case studies emerge as a way to both promote providing data to Europeana and for promoting a more innovative approach towards digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Change in data quality can be better supported at a national level with a policy focus on better quality data. The relationship between Europeana and the national aggregators is strengthened by holding a national workshop, and this is also critical to delivering impact on a local level e.g. by understanding the local context and needs. In this vein, developing relationships with their national aggregator was an outcome for some workshop attendees. We understand this as one of many steps that form a journey towards ‘digital transformation’. Europeana’s task is, therefore, to consider, in tandem with aggregators, how gaps in capacity development and skills amongst Europe’s cultural heritage institutions can be met at different stages and at scale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This research creates a baseline against which to increase the strength of the outcomes Europeana creates. We have found that the structure of pre-, post- and longitudinal surveying is effective and should be further improved, when being implemented in all future training events. The findings we present are, however, informed by relatively small samples of data and would be strengthened by a larger data set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The national workshops unearthed a need for more practical training, which Europeana can support but not deliver at scale on a national level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">National workshops could be structured better to meet the needs of those at different levels of digital maturity and on the journey towards digital change.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Closer partnership working with aggregators is recommended.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For documentation purposes, it would be valuable for the organisers of national workshops - or indeed any activity - to document any outcomes they have identified and to capture the impressions and potential next steps of the participants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Further work could be done to introduce the question of attributing economic value to Europeana’s services (in total or regarding discrete services).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana should improve communication about its data collection / impact assessment expectations. Good relationships with event organisers and national aggregators are key to good data collection around national workshops. It is important to also explain how the data will be used to encourage participation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The draft report was shared with aggregators involved in delivering national workshops. It was also shared with the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum. No feedback was given. The report will inform the work of both the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and Europeana Foundation in terms of further supporting capacity building in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Transcribathon is an online crowdsourcing platform for the enrichment of European digital cultural heritage. Its goal is to engage the public in transcribing and&nbsp; annotating Europeana’s vast collection of digitised items, amassed from libraries, archives and museums from all across Europe. Many of these items, especially those containing handwritten text, hold a treasure trove of hidden information not yet displayed in the metadata and therefore not readily discernible nor searchable. With the help of the public in transforming this digital heritage—by transcribing the text, annotating the contents and adding valuable descriptions—they can become rich and powerful sources of information. The data can then be sent back to the Europeana website and become easily read, searched, and categorised to the benefit of the wider public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first prototype of the Transcribathon tool was created in 2014 and the platform was updated, improved and extended in 2019 as a result of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enrich-europeana\">Enrich Europeana Generic Services project</a>. This impact assessment was commissioned as part of this project and it presents an analysis of data collected during two Transcribathon events in Cluj-Napoca, Romania (December 2019) and Wroclaw, Poland (January 2020). Our focus was on the perspective of young people, relating primarily to skills development and connection with cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Participant perspectives were captured using Mentimeter participatory data collection software during the introduction to the event and the closing presentation. This was then analysed and compared to past survey data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">These Transcribathon events encouraged participants to learn more about historical topics by creating a strong connection with and a desire to learn more about part of their history and culture. Interaction with the Transcribathon tool at the events encouraged participants to think differently about cultural heritage preservation and reuse, with respondents suggesting different types of value this has, like preservation for future generations and the importance of heritage documents being available and accessible. Transcribathon, at least in the short-term, encouraged participants to engage with digital exhibitions and archives (more than museums and galleries).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Transcribathon is a valuable educational tool. The evidence suggests that it inspired the participating students and increased their subject knowledge. It supported the development of transcription and historical analytical skills (relating to working with historical sources), and to a lesser degree, on how they interact or engage with cultural heritage or use cultural heritage in their education. We also think that it supports the development of soft and digital skills, though this should be further investigated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Regarding a sense of identity, the data suggests that Transcribathon’s greatest outcome is in generating a sense of connection with one’s local culture and history. The study did not isolate whether they understand more about their local community, nation or family, or if their feelings of its value changed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This analysis and the data included in the report should be interpreted bearing in mind the short time-frame in which it was conducted, the acknowledged limitations to the approach and recommendations for future research. A longitudinal perspective is required to show if and how Transcribathon creates a concrete and longer term engagement with cultural heritage in their educational activities. The report provides some thoughts for future strategic development of Transcribathon, including, for example, how stronger impact could be created through increased engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Transcribathon has positive outcomes for young people at Transcribathon events in the short-term, which sets the context for longer-term engagement with digital cultural heritage, better educational outcomes and a connection with the heritage of their local community, region or nation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Future research could prioritise counterfactual research (to assess young people’s potential change in levels of knowledge and skills).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Interviews may be a better way to understand if and how participant’s understanding of their local community, nation or family changes as a result of attending Transcribathon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Spend more time considering the impact areas and test each of these for their relevance to the project. The language used in each of the long-term and short-term outcomes should be similarly tested in more depth and more causal steps outlined between the identified outcomes and impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Areas for additional research include: What is the value of Transcribathon as an online tool for (sustained) classroom use (e.g. soft skill and digital skills development)? What is the value of the increased reusability and findability of cultural heritage content (thanks to additional metadata and textual transcription by Transcribathon participants)? What is the value of hosting a Transcribathon event? Does the gamification of cultural heritage engagement relate to a desire for more engagement in (digital) cultural heritage for young people?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A first version of the report was submitted to the European Commission as part of the reporting of the Generic Services project. Project partners were involved in the drafting and sign off of the original report. The report was then restructured and simplified for publication, and partners were also involved in giving feedback on this version.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The short-term event data collection approach has been tested a few times, and is now a standard part of the workflow of a Transcribathon event. Some work on the change pathway for Transcribathon is needed. Future steps also include embedding data collection in online Transcribathon activity, as well as considering how to investigate any longer-term outcomes for participants of Transcribathons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Coinciding with the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Europeana organises two cultural heritage policy oriented presidency conferences every year together with the Member States holding the presidency. The events bring together high-level policy makers from European ministries of culture, cultural operators and professionals, experts in the topic, representatives of the European Commission and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\">DCHE Expert Group</a> to secure the network's outreach to EU Member States and to discuss topics of current focus of the digital cultural heritage sector and the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first step was to review the outputs/documentation of past presidency events. Post-event questionnaires were then sent to attendees of the 2019 presidency events at the time of the event and therefore before this impact assessment was planned. These data were reviewed (the sample was very small). Together with Europeana colleagues, a Change Pathway was developed following the Impact Playbook methodology. A framework was created for future data collection, including a registration survey, revised post-presidency event surveys, and a follow-up for participants of the events, to be sent at least six months after the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We wanted to trial the Croatian presidency event as the first event where we would begin monitoring the social demographics of event attendees at the event registration stage. We created four questions that could be used to track the diversity of event attendees, namely, relating to age, gender, country they represent and disability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The events consisted of invited attendees, most of whom had been to Europeana events previously. While there were slightly varying degrees of the practical awareness of Europeana’s frameworks, this is not unexpected for an event that brings together both high-level policy-orientated participants and also experts from other fields.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The strategic nature of the event was an influencing motivation for those who attended, and most of the attendees report that contributing to (and thus further developing) the discussion on the policy area as a driver for their participation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The event appeared to satisfy all the cohorts (a combined satisfaction rating of 7+ out of 10 in the topics we surveyed). While Network development was not a big driver for participants, all but one respondent noted that they made new contacts, while two noted that they consolidated their existing network. In future, we should investigate more - and value - the opportunity for participants to consolidate and strengthen their networks at events, particularly when the guests are more likely to know each other (e.g. policy makers or members of the Digital Cultural Heritage Expert [DCHE] group).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Limitations due to COVID-19</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the COVID-19 pandemic striking as we were due to send a follow-up questionnaire to participants of the 2019 presidency events, our impact assessment plan had to change. It was felt to be inappropriate to add extra burden to the participants of the 2019 presidency events due to the likelihood of their attention being needed elsewhere during the preliminary months of the crisis. A similar approach was followed in other assessments. For that reason, this report does not present the intended longer-term perspective we had hoped to gain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A framework to support the impact assessment for future presidency events, including the development of indicators and question types for inclusion in future registration, post-workshop and follow-up questionnaires for participants, has been created. This should be embedded for future presidency events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The development of this framework has contributed to the overall development of questions to monitor the demographics and diversity of participants, the creation of a standardised question bank and the standardisation of processes for capturing data from events participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report was validated internally within the Europeana Foundation. Future reports on the impact of presidency events will have external validation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital programming, or Europeana’s webinar and events programming, increased dramatically as a result of the ‘new normal’&nbsp; of COVID-19. This was a new area of priority, and one in which many colleagues within the Europeana initiative have been involved. We took the opportunity to understand the impact that Europeana’s digital programming, mainly webinars and online participatory meetings, have for participants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We worked to develop a standard data collection protocol for Europeana’s digital (and other) events, in which data is collected at the registration stage (demographic information, confidence in the topic), and via a post-event survey&nbsp; sent to participants of all events. This protocol further embeds evaluation in Europeana by standardising its approach to data collection. It also reflects a reflective and learning approach, through which improvements can be made on an iterative basis as recommendations are shared.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We set in place a confidence rating in the topic that could be assessed before the event and then again afterwards. Unlike previous pre- and post-event surveys, we also trialled a way to capture some identifying information (first name and country) that would help us understand impact on an individual level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report presents preliminary insights into the knowledge outcomes experienced by attendees at Europeana’s digital events, namely webinars. This is a very light touch report. Only two webinars were surveyed due to the need at the time to understand if the methodology was appropriate to use and to feed into the summary report on 10 impact assessment reports, due in June 2020 as a milestone under the DSI-4 project. This is acknowledged as a limitation to the perspectives presented below, but it also sets in place a mechanism for further assessment of participant experiences going forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This was the first programme of events for which Europeana has been able to track audience demographics. There were more non-ENA members than ENA members registered for the events, suggesting that the opportunities reached an audience beyond only our network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The largest group of attendees were those aged between 35-44 followed by those aged 45-54. Least represented were young people (18-24) and those over 65+ (retired). The digital events are largely female-dominated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The majority of the audience did not consider themselves to have a disability. When respondents suggested that they did have a disability, there were no concrete suggestions given about how Europeana could better facilitate access to its services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A wide geographic range of attendees were attracted to events, including those outside of the EU, from regions such as Canada, the US, Russia, the Western Balkans, Saudi Arabia and Mexico.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We were able to track confidence levels on an individual level before and after the webinar. The data show us that the majority of participants found that their confidence levels in the topic increased after the webinar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital programming series has just begun and the cross-team delivering it are ambitious - see, for example, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars\">webinars page</a> which illustrates the number of events that have been programmed from a relatively low baseline. The results that emerge after each webinar should be regularly reviewed to assess the outcomes that are emerging. Furthermore, further insights could be captured through interviews or focus groups with members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and use of these findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These results were shared with the Members’ Council of the Europeana Network Association and organisers of events, for example, the Communicators’ Community. Feedback was assessed and incorporated where appropriate. The findings have informed future programming (content and audience needs). They have also informed broader conversations on how we measure the impact of our digital events and how we set targets and KPIs to continue to grow the audience engaged in our activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report was designed to be a first and light-touch attempt to evaluate how our impact assessment procedures at digital events were operating. Data are being collected on an ongoing basis and a more in-depth assessment is due in mid to late 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of 2020, the electoral term of three members of the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> came to an end. We would like to express our gratitude to the former Chair <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-de-niet\">Marco de Niet</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/stephan-bartholmei\">Stephan Bartholmei</a> for their invaluable contributions to the successes of the ENA over the past couple of years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the renewed Board of five members - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a> (Chair), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/robert-davies\">Rob Davies</a> (Vice-chair), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/frederik-truyen\">Fred Truyen</a> (Treasurer), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/georgia-angelaki\">Georgia Angelaki</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/milena-dobreva\">Milena Dobreva</a> - we will continue to oversee the running of the network. Our main focus will be on providing guidance and a governance framework for ENA Communities, Task Forces and Working Groups, and on evaluating work progress. Read about our priorities below!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Supporting capacity building and digital transformation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this time of a global crisis, we in the ENA believe, more than ever, in the power of culture as a positive force in the lives of all human beings and as an encouragement to our societies to find new meanings and values within them. The ENA aspires to be a positive-minded community that welcomes innovation, crosses borders and domains, and embraces diversity. Our main objective for 2021 is the empowerment of our members to seize their digital opportunities so they can provide a positive contribution to their local network, and the global community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the ENA communities and in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a> (EF) and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> (EAF) we will keep supporting the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage institutions. Important work is underway to define how each of the bodies of the Europeana Initiative can work to promote digital transformation in alignment with the Europeana capacity building framework. These efforts will help to deliver a comprehensive package of capacity building support.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Harnessing the potential of ENA members</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Active engagement and empowerment of ENA members has been and will remain our key priority. In 2021, we will keep focusing our efforts on expanding the ENA, and find ways to&nbsp; make our members feel more involved and actively engaged. We will take actions to make the ENA more inclusive for people of all kinds of backgrounds, provide more opportunities for students and emerging professionals to get involved with the ENA, and enable more multilingual collaborations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe that identifying, encouraging and channelling the potential, skills and enthusiasm of our members is a prerequisite for a sustainable and active network. We plan to create a new ENA Working Group on Membership to examine membership benefits&nbsp;and participation strategies, and to help guide new members through their ENA journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Inclusivity and diversity&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more diverse and inclusive representation, recognising key social and cultural issues and needs, is critical for the success and growth of ENA, becoming an integral part of all we do. Promoting ownership and management of diversity initiatives by members of the communities involved is important in&nbsp;our approach to inclusivity and diversity. Initiatives are needed to identify people from diverse communities and engage their involvement. The ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a>, which is nearing completion, will make recommendations&nbsp;relevant to ENA strategy, and an ENA forum has been established to enable discussion around anti-racism. ENA will work closely with the Foundation and the EAF on inclusion and diversity related activities in the form of a dedicated Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Closer collaboration across the Europeana Initiative&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ENA can help to increase the impact of the Europeana Initiative’s digital transformation mission in the sector, and together with EAF, provide a rich source of expertise. In the coming year, we will continue to work closely with the EF and EAF to strengthen the Europeana Initiative, also collaborating more closely with the EF Advisory Board and Supervisory Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe that transparency of planning, communication and decision making is crucial for&nbsp;success, positive alignment and harmonious relations between the ENA Management Board, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> and the ENA membership. This will require clearer accountability for ENA&nbsp;strategies and actions, together with democratic process for their approval.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Communities, Task Forces and Working Groups&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">six ENA communities</a> are the ENA’s most important instrument in addressing the digital challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions. We look forward to their activities as they continue to work as trans-national networks of professionals and experts who cultivate and share knowledge and practices around common topics of interest. The communities’ plans for the year can be found in their individual work plans - find these on each community page, along with details of ongoing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces\">Task Forces and Working Groups</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These ENA structures provide a sound basis for current activities, but in the coming year we also want to focus on improving collaboration between community Steering Groups and members, engaging volunteers more productively and innovating online discussion formats. We will evaluate the actions we take to do this to ensure that we are constantly improving and iterating within the ENA. Finally, we will continue to ensure that our activities, within and beyond the ENA, are as sustainable and climate neutral as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about ENA’s strategic priorities and activities foreseen for this year in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2020/Europeana-Network-Association-Activity-Plan-2021.pdf\">2021 ENA Activity Plan</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join the ENA</a> - it’s free and easy to sign up today and be part of this democratic community of&nbsp;professionals working in the field of digital cultural heritage!</p>\r\n"

As a result of the digital conference, this report proposes possible steps forward, both for the Europeana Initiative and for Member States, in order to support the sector, namely:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Recommendations for the Europeana Initiative:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Cooperate with the EUIPO and relevant stakeholders on Out of commerce works (OOCWs) for the success of the development of the portal and the availability and suitability of licenses for cultural heritage institutions (CHIs).&nbsp;</li>\r\n        <li>Monitor the 20th century blackhole to evaluate whether the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive&nbsp;(CDSM) Directive contributes to an increase of available digital cultural heritage from that period.</li>\r\n        <li>Create copyright training opportunities and support other copyright training.</li>\r\n        <li>Monitor copyright support provided by Member States.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Recommendations for Member States:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Reiterate the importance of having a functional and interoperable portal for OOCWs.</li>\r\n        <li>Build copyright capacity in the cultural heritage sector to increase the knowledge and confidence when dealing with digital cultural heritage.</li>\r\n        <li>Encourage the use of standardised copyright tools to support the reuse of digital cultural heritage and the digital transformation of CHIs.</li>\r\n        <li>Adopt clear, simple and broad provisions transposing the CDSM Directive to ensure their effectiveness, in consultation with stakeholders.</li>\r\n        <li>Ensure that there is funding available for CHIs to, among other things, conclude licenses for OOCWs.</li>\r\n        <li>Facilitate steady conversations, beyond the CDSM Directive, between all relevant stakeholders in copyright conversations.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Conference was organised in collaboration with the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek and under the auspices of the German Presidency of the Council.

                body: "<h3><strong>Definitions and terms for AI&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI terminology can be complex, so let's clear up some definitions. While reading our posts you might see terms like ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, ‘models’ or ‘training’. Machine learning vs deep learning is a common area of confusion for those not familiar with AI techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Machine learning consists of a set of algorithms which automatically learn from data. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that excels in solving problems with high dimensionality (where the number of features is much greater than the number of observations). Computer vision and natural language processing fall under this category. Deep learning uses a family of models inspired by the structure and functioning of the brain (artificial neural networks) that effectively learn to extract relevant features from the data. The outcome of training a machine learning algorithm is a predictive 'model' that can be used to generate additional metadata from content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By now we all know about data models, like the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>. They are a mechanism that helps heritage institutions structure metadata related to heritage objects. But what do we mean when we talk about an AI model? It’s an algorithm that has been trained to do a certain task - for example, to determine if it’s seeing an apple or an orange. It will be trained to look for key characteristics of apples and oranges and whether it’s accurate or not. This is a rudimentary example but the principle is the same as you scale up - it just requires a lot more data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AI for cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With our apples and oranges example, you can already start to imagine how AI is valuable for cultural heritage. AI has the capacity to generate extensive amounts of data that can be used to enrich heritage collections - making them easier to explore, so people can find what they’re looking for, institutes can link with other collections and so much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And since there is already so much digitised cultural heritage data and materials that have been described by trusted heritage experts, the quality of the data is extremely valuable. For example, rather than picking 100,000 random paintings from the internet and training a model against them to recognize ‘impressionist art’ you can use heritage materials that will already be able to give hints and guidance for accuracy. But AI extends beyond paintings - it’s currently being implemented in all areas of cultural heritage material from 3D imaging, sound, video and text.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AI and Europeana&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Europeana, the potential that AI has for improving data-quality, a continuous pain point for collection users, could offer exciting opportunities. In the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020 - 2025</a>, AI is highlighted multiple times as a means to an end for data quality improvement. The plan states:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>‘Manually improving the metadata quality of millions of records from different sources requires a huge amount of time and resources. The application of artificial intelligence tools and machine-learning networks for automatic enrichment, combined with human knowledge provided by domain experts, offers a remarkable opportunity for improving the quality of metadata.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But with great power, comes great responsibility. AI poses numerous ethical challenges that need to be closely considered. There are currently several initiatives across Europe looking into the ethical concerns of AI and Europeana will work in line with the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai\">Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming weeks, we will be sharing activities including the outcomes from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">EuropeanaTech AI in relation to GLAMs</a> Task Force and the Task Force’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-europeanatech-challenge-for-europeana-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-datasets\">open challenge for the creation of machine learning datasets</a> based on Europeana data, as well as exploring cultural heritage projects related to AI. You’ll read about work happening internally at Europeana Foundation, and as March is <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History Month</a>, we’ll also be highlighting and interviewing women who are leading projects and research in the field of AI and the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep checking <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro news</a> for more and join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech community</a> to get involved in Europeana’s work!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF)</a> advocates for and coordinates all the activities required for an effective aggregation ecosystem which makes data from cultural heritage organisations all over Europe available through Europeana. The EAF has significantly grown over the last few years, and 2020 saw exciting developments take place which strengthened its role and will support new activities in 2021!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Strategic and governance changes&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana’s 38 accredited aggregators who make up the EAF come together in a meeting twice a year, and in 2020 these meetings took place online over two days in May and October. At the meeting in May, aggregators held a copyright <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySxLYCxUHv8\">webinar</a> to develop knowledge around identifying copyright status and selecting rights statements.&nbsp; In October, they approved important strategic documents such as the ‘<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjGN6zHRUsPWURx3ReBWzNgO4H0R2tBivmjtg8joaEo/edit?usp=sharing\">Recommendations for a European Member States and Commission supported digital aggregation strategy’</a> for the Expert Group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana (DCHE); and discussed the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\">Europeana DSI aggregation strategy</a>. In their meeting in May 2020, the EAF also approved <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/shaping-the-role-of-the-europeana-aggregators-forum-within-the-europeana-initiative\">changes to its governance structure</a> to manage and distribute workload more efficiently across the Steering Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Alignment with the ENA</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since early 2020, the EAF and the Europeana Network Association (ENA) have been working to align their activities and develop a closer working relationship. The EAF Steering Group now collaborates closely with the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, and in 2021 they will meet on a quarterly basis. This collaboration is reflected in other activities - the ENA and EAF can now work together on Task Forces and Working Groups, and the <a href=\"https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=1ef7745526\">monthly ENA newsletter</a> also highlights news from the EAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Task Forces and Working Groups</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020, the EAF started running its own Task Forces and Working Groups, which have already undertaken inspiring work! In spring, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/iiif-europeana-working-group\">IIIF Working Group</a> was launched to work on IIIF adoption, training, and translation of resources, and in late summer&nbsp;the EAF Advocacy Task Force worked to produce <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjGN6zHRUsPWURx3ReBWzNgO4H0R2tBivmjtg8joaEo/edit\">aggregation policy recommendations</a>, advocating for renewed support for aggregators at national and European level. In November, the Aggregator User Group was set up to manage feedback to the Europeana Foundation about the main products of the Europeana Core Service Platform and will continue to work in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming months, a new task force will be launched in relation to the Europeana capacity building framework. It will focus on developing a knowledge sharing platform and establishing structured training activities by and for the aggregators. The EAF will also continue to prepare for the launch of the Library Working Group, which will provide support and a discussion forum for the national libraries providing data to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A robust accreditation scheme</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2018, the EAF established an accreditation process for accepting new members, and in 2020, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/technische-informationsbibliothek-tib-av-portal\">Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) - AV Portal</a>, received accreditation, bringing the number of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">aggregators represented in the EAF</a> to 38. Two more members are awaiting accreditation - the national aggregator of Cyprus and Estonia. In 2021, the accreditation scheme is going to be reviewed to make sure it can sustain EAF membership more effectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Supporting digital transformation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the year, aggregators have taken part in a number of initiatives which intend to support digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector. In June 2020, twelve aggregator representatives took part in a series of ‘sense-making’ workshops around ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">Digital transformation in the time of</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\"> COVID-19</a>’. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-sense-making-workshops-findings-and-outcomes\">findings</a> and outcomes of this process provided valuable insights into the different ways that the pandemic has affected people’s and institutions’ work, and they were further discussed within the EAF framework in a dedicated session in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the summer, on behalf of the Europeana Initiative, the EAF also provided response to the European Commission’s consultation on ‘<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-opportunities-offered-digital-technologies-culture-heritage-sector\">Opportunities Offered By Digital</a><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-opportunities-offered-digital-technologies-culture-heritage-sector\">&nbsp;Technologies For The Cultural Heritage Sector</a>’ in the form of a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-initiative-position-consultation-on-opportunities-offered-by-digital-technologies\">common position paper</a> that underlined critical elements to executing the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Aspirations for 2021</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a successful 2020, in 2021 the EAF will keep supporting cultural heritage institutions across Europe to seize digital opportunities for their collections and make them accessible online at&nbsp;a high quality. The main activities for 2021 will include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Expanding and strengthening&nbsp;the EAF and adding value for its members&nbsp;by reviewing the accreditation scheme.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Creating opportunities for collaboration and supporting emerging aggregators to join the network.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Working closely with the Europeana Foundation and the ENA on a capacity building framework and around the topic of diversity and inclusion.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Engaging accredited aggregators in improving the Europeana aggregation infrastructure and Europeana products.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Improving the quality of aggregated metadata and content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Advocating at the European Commission and the Member State level for the aggregators’ role.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Strengthening ties with the Europeana Foundation, ENA and other sectoral bodies to help step up the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, in 2021, the terms of two members of the current EAF Steering Group - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-rendina\">Marco Rendina</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> - will come to an end. The election of new members will take place in mid May, and the handover of activities as well as the internal election of Chair and Vice-chair will take place after the spring EAF meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the EAF is planning to organise an online awareness event in June to give the aggregators a platform to reach out to their networks, and each other. It will be a great opportunity to raise awareness of the EAF, and to showcase the work of different aggregators to the broader Europeana network and to cultural heritage institutions across Europe. We will share more information about the event soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about the EAF activities in 2020 and 2021 in their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Aggregation/EAF-activity-report-2020.pdf\">Activity Report</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Aggregation/EAF-activity-plan-2021.pdf\">Activity Plan</a>.</p>\r\n"

One of these - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Saint George on a Bike</a> - is a CEF Telecom (Public Open Data) project we are working on with Europeana Foundation. It departs from our more typical focus on Smart Cities to explore how technology, and artificial intelligence in particular, can improve our knowledge of cultural heritage and make it more accessible for non-specialists. Our approach relies on neural networks, language models, and semantic inference to automatically generate enriched metadata and captions for iconographic paintings from the 12th to 18th centuries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your career path to your role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My research career has covered several different areas, connected through the common topic of programming language design. My background allowed me to apply my knowledge of hardware (automatic system synthesis during my PhD and PostDoc at MIT) to widely distributed systems, actor models, and software engineering while working at IBM Research, and embedded systems during my time as a Visiting Professor at Universidad Carlos III of Madrid. I also applied Machine Learning techniques to learn expressive models for opera singers in collaboration with Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and jointly built a simulator for infectious diseases, which we have now tuned for COVID-19 in collaboration with Carlos III University and the Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you working on right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are halfway through Saint George on a Bike, and at the point where our focus is turning to connecting the results of the data mining and deep learning approach. We have been developing this with top-down semantic inferencing to generate visual relationships and improve the labels of the objects we are detecting in paintings. It's an exciting time that opens increasingly interesting research questions!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a group, we find cultural heritage an extremely rich domain with huge potential for artificial intelligence. While this is a field that all of us can relate to, none of us is a specialist and joint work with cultural heritage experts is fundamental. Our collaboration with Europeana has so far been very positive in this respect. This project is an open door to a field we had not considered before, and we are very excited about the opportunities and possible collaborations with different types of stakeholders for this work - from museums to people with disabilities or education.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest opportunity AI presents for the cultural heritage sector?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Data mining is typically used when vast amounts of data are available and we want to extract knowledge from it. This is not the case with cultural heritage, which has a limited number of data points (artefacts), of many different styles. This creates both a challenge and an opportunity for mixed approaches that work together to refine each other or detect inconsistencies. This is the approach we are trying right now in Saint George on a Bike, with promising results in terms of generating rich metadata about the objects, topics, and actions depicted in paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe the greatest opportunity that this rich metadata can bring to the cultural heritage sector lies in its impact on consumers of culture, reviving and expanding the interest in culture, making it more digestible, relatable, and pervasive. This can start with school education and extend to areas such as the creative industries or cultural tourism. At a more profound level, culture reflects the identity of people and societies across time and having a better understanding of our past, its biases and inequalities, could help us become a more inclusive and tolerant society.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the biggest challenge?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe that technically the most difficult aspect for AI in cultural heritage is capturing meaning, symbols, and common sense. These are fundamentally human endeavors and constitute harder problems than simply learning correlations as they model reasoning based on knowledge that is rarely part of the input data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The line of work we are following in Saint George on a Bike tackles the interesting technical problem of endowing AI with cultural insight. The main challenge is to understand the context at the time that an image was created, the context outside which the symbols, traditions, and rules that it reflects lose meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/\">study from 2018</a> suggests that just 12% of machine learning researchers are women. What do you think can be done to encourage more women into the field?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My background is in Computer Systems rather than AI and when I was in grad school, most women in our building were in fact in AI and the numbers were reasonably high. Nevertheless, the percentage you mention refers to machine learning, which is but one field in AI. It´s true that if we look at the sheer number of papers, it may seem like it has taken over the whole field!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Computer Science has always been male-dominated; I think fields where the majority of workers are male raise problems not just for women, but for anyone who is not super-competitive, (appears) aggressive, assertive, or simply loud enough. That being said, I think affirmative action must be applied with great care. Not everyone learns or works best following the same processes, nor do they necessarily consider the same thing as a strength or a weakness. I believe we need not just give more opportunities to people that don't fit the canons, but rather allow them to do things differently and be evaluated differently for what they can bring to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my experience in academia and industry I repeatedly saw that most - not all - women are highly motivated by how their work will be applied, and tend to join areas that have some connection to the society or the individual. In AI these may be recognition (voice, face), language, cognitive processes, reasoning, or applications for education, health, or culture. I don't have a recipe for how to attract women to the field, but I think AI is better equipped than other Computer Science areas to do that. I suppose this is not the most optimistic view, given the numbers.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Tell us about your current role.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve been deputy director for Services and Networks at the National Library of France (BnF) since 2014. This is a management position within the library: our team is composed of about 600 people working in all library-related technical areas, from IT to preservation (physical and digital) and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your career path to your current role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I was a student at the Ecole nationale des chartes, a university specialising in the study of cultural heritage which prepares students for careers in libraries, archives and museums. I used to specialise in 17th century prints! But I turned towards digital activities very soon in my career. In 2003, I started working in the Digital Library Department at the BnF, focusing on topics such as metadata management, user oriented design, digital preservation and semantic web.&nbsp;All of these topics had a great potential for international discussions, and very soon I became involved in international networks like <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/\">IFLA</a>, Europeana and the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a>. Then for three years (2011-2014) I left the BnF to work in a museum, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, where I was in charge of a great digital transformation programme. I came back to the BnF in my current position in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you working on right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve spent the last five years working on establishing a new service for researchers in digital humanities, called the BnF Data Lab. In 2020, the BnF director general asked me to lead a task force on artificial intelligence to establish a roadmap for the next five years for our library. We framed a three year programme that will be co-engineered with several partners in the academic, cultural heritage and commercial fields. This will touch many - if not all - aspects of the library’s activities. The first areas where we will develop AI projects include image mining in Gallica, our digital library, and handwriting text recognition (HTR). But we will also conduct experiments in other domains such as predictive data for conservation policies, georeferencing ancient maps of Paris. Many of these projects come to life in our new Data Lab, opening this autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, as a manager, I’m involved in lots of projects, including the development of a new cataloguing system called Noemi, and a programme we are running to ingest digital legal deposit (especially audio and video). But I’m also one of the main contacts for international matters related to technology. Three important consortiums have my attention recently: the <a href=\"https://netpreserve.org/\">International Internet Preservation Consortium</a> which focuses on web preservation, the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a>, and the <a href=\"http://ai4lam.org\">AI4LAM</a> community focused on artificial intelligence for archives, libraries and museums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest opportunity AI presents for the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI is already a reality in our day-to-day lives: we have conversations with our smartphones, listen to algorithms-designed playlists, drive cars that warn us when we go off the road - so it’s really just a matter of time before it starts being a professional reality for the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The promises held by this technology are numerous: as we’ve spent the past 20 years building massive digital collections, AI may be at some point the only way to make them understandable and findable for our users. I think of collections like digitised ancient newspapers, web archives, some collections of ancient photographs that we haven’t yet catalogued or the tens of thousands of music albums that go live every year. The predictive features of AI could help us provide our users with personalised recommendations, but also be instrumental in management operations such as conservation policies, cataloguing or analysis of the collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the biggest challenge?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right now, I’d say the main question is: how to make the dream come true? The technology is mature enough, we have data, tools and use cases, and we’ve been able to demonstrate the efficiency of AI in the framework of research projects. But we are still far from integrating AI in production in our information systems. First, we need appropriate skills within our teams, and with a fast-evolving technology such as AI, this is not easy to achieve. Second, our legacy systems don’t talk easily with the new AI architecture: a strong data governance is required in order to make AI possible, and we may have to rethink the very core of our applications. Finally, moving towards AI is a costly effort, but I’m convinced that it will be worth the investment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/\"><em>study from 2018</em></a> suggests that just 12% of machine learning researchers are women. What do you think can be done to encourage more women into the field?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I want to believe that the times when women felt excluded by the study of sciences or techniques are already behind us; hopefully mentalities are changing. A woman who wants to be a software developer, for instance, won’t be systematically discouraged by the schools and companies being only filled with men. But I’d also say that AI is about much more than just tech: there is a place for people like myself who are neither engineers or scientists, but rather focused on the impact of this technology in various areas of life and culture. If we want to build successful AI projects, we need to involve people who are experts in content of heritage collections, data models, UX design, data visualisation and other areas of knowledge that rely heavily on social sciences and humanities. Many ethical issues have also arisen in relationship with AI: biases in datasets, acceptability of change, ecological impact. If we’re going to build the world of tomorrow using AI, we need a human approach to its development, we need to design it for and with the people as a whole, and not only the male-half of humanity.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about your current role.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since September 2017 I've been leading the <a href=\"https://dhlab.nl\">Digital Humanities Research Lab</a> at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science Humanities Cluster (<a href=\"https://huc.knaw.nl/\">KNAW HuC</a>). We work on advancing computational methods for humanities research. We mostly focus on language technology and semantic web, with the occasional excursion to network analysis and computer vision. My work is part research, part management, and part fostering collaborations across the Humanities Cluster (an alliance of three research institutes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your career path to your current role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My BA and MA were in Language and Artificial Intelligence, and I was interested in language and computers from quite early on. For my Ph.D. project, I spent a good chunk of my time at the <a href=\"https://www.naturalis.nl/\">Naturalis Biodiversity Center</a>, the largest natural history museum in the Netherlands. My project was funded by the <a href=\"http://www.nwo.nl/catch\">Continuous Access to Cultural Heritage (CATCH)</a> programme that the Dutch Research Council ran for 10 years. Initially, projects in this programme were set up as collaborations between computer science departments and heritage institutions. This is where I really learnt to work across domains and also realised that there is so much potential in the combination of these different disciplines - and I really like working at this intersection!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After my Ph.D., I transitioned into another CATCH project, Agora, where we collaborated with historians, the Rijksmuseum and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. We extracted and modelled the ‘who, what, where and when’ in collections to make links between objects based on the events depicted in or associated with them, rather than metadata such as who created the object and what materials were used. I then did another postdoc on the FP7 funded NewsReader project, where I continued working on event-based information extraction and modelling, but then with journalists and decision makers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you working on right now?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have three research strands that may look disjointed to an outsider, but for me are very much connected through the methodologies I use and the way I approach these projects! The first is a H2020 funded project called <a href=\"https://odeuropa.eu/\">Odeuropa</a> where we aim to make our scent heritage searchable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m also one of the scientific directors of the <a href=\"https://www.cultural-ai.nl/\">Cultural AI lab</a>, a collaboration between various research and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands aimed at improving AI through cultural heritage and improving cultural heritage through AI. One of the things I’ve seen is that digital humanities research can be one-way traffic; the knowledge of the humanities scholar and archival sources aren’t used to improve AI systems. With this lab, we want to integrate knowledge from the heritage institutions (both from their archives as well as their collection managers) into AI systems such that we can make them less biased and more inclusive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, I’m working with colleagues from the UK, Norway and the Netherlands on a <a href=\"https://dhlab-nl.github.io/sustainable-recipes\">small Alpro foundation funded project</a> to investigate the sustainability of Dutch, German and British diets over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest opportunity AI presents for the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can and should use AI technologies to make cultural heritage more accessible. This means not just searchable, but also more insightful to identify gaps and imbalances. I think there’s a big opportunity here to work together with visualisation experts and data scientists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the biggest challenge?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest challenge I think is to overcome our blind spots, both in terms of data and technology, and to make our data and AI systems <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">FAIR</a> and transparent. I think now there is a big trend towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\">deep learning</a>. I see it with all my students (it’s the first thing they want to try), but when we have such complex things to communicate to the world as our cultural heritage, we need to know what the system did to get to a particular enrichment or link between objects. So I would like to take a step back and see what we can do with more ‘old-fashioned’ techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In five years time, what do you hope that AI has brought to cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I hope that AI will have helped us uncover or rediscover interesting corners of our heritage collections. At Rijksmuseum, most people will know the Nightwatch and go straight there, but this and other institutions have millions of other objects that are just as interesting. Research by my Cultural AI colleagues found that also in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7559558/\">online searches a lot of these lesser known objects</a> just don’t come to the surface. I hope we can change that!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/\">A study from 2018</a> suggests that just 12% of machine learning researchers are women. What do you think can be done to encourage more women into the field?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a difficult one because there are just so many aspects to this problem, from lack of visible role models, affordable childcare and (<a href=\"https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2020/18/gender-pay-gap-still-narrowing\">at least in the Netherlands</a>) women generally working fewer hours than men. I think we can start with making women more visible, and there are loads of awesome women working in machine learning (see for example <a href=\"https://wimlworkshop.org/\">WiML</a>). What’s really needed is a culture change where diverse teams (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sianbeilock/2019/04/04/how-diversity-leads-to-better-outcomes/\">which are found to perform better in many situations</a>) become the default. What has helped me personally is having a few mentors to bounce ideas off. Aside from that, everyone can pay attention to not only invite men to a panel, as keynote speakers or to their grant proposal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have helped push technological boundaries in various domains, including in the cultural heritage sector (the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/Final_Interim_Report_AI_in_GLAMs_TF.pdf\">Interim Report</a> of the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force</a> and the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam\">AI4LAM</a> initiative provide some examples). To encourage innovation in this area, a few weeks ago EuropeanaTech announced its first <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-europeanatech-challenge-for-europeana-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-datasets\">Challenge for Europeana AI/ML Datasets</a>. With this new activity, we wanted to stimulate the creation of datasets for the GLAM sector that can be used for AI/ML, drawing from the rich cultural heritage resources available in Europeana. We hope that the availability of such datasets could help to foster more engagement with digital cultural heritage data in AI/ML and support the transfer of recent advances in AI/ML to the field of digital curation and analysis of cultural heritage content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We received a total of five proposals, which were carefully reviewed by members of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech#steering-group\">EuropeanaTech Steering Group</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams#members\">AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force</a>. They assessed the proposals based on their relevance for the GLAM sector (25%), relevance for AI/ML (25%), relation to Europeana (30%) and clarity of the description and work plan (20%).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Announcing the winners</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Named Entities in Archeological Texts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This proposal from a team based at the University of Naples 'L'Orientale'&nbsp;aims to create a dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Term Extraction for archeological terms in Italian and English in the Europeana Archeology collection. NER is the process of identifying proper names such as person names or locations in unstructured text. Term Extraction is similar, but focuses on finding specialised terms, in this case from the archeology domain. Vocabularies like Getty and CIDOC CRM will be considered. The final dataset could be used in the development and evaluation of AI/ML based technologies for NER in the archeology domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reviewers particularly appreciated the clear structure and maturity of the proposal, for which a mock dataset was already made using <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana’s APIs</a> to test the approach proposed. The bilingual aspect and the scarcity of similar open resources for the archeology field were also seen as particularly valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Zac Grace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This proposal by a student of the Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Tarbes aims to create pixel masks for semantic segmentation, through manual annotation of image data in the Europeana Fashion collection. This means that, for example, when an image is analysed, the relevant fashion elements (shirt, trousers, shoes) in the image are then marked with their pixel outlines. Such data can be used for training an automated segmentation system.</p>\r\n"

These can then be used to bootstrap and evaluate (semi-)automatic methods for detecting such terms in cultural heritage collections. Contentious terms here means those words or phrases that are suggestive of some (implicit or explicit) bias towards or against a group, event, or otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reviewers valued how this proposal aims to address a key target in the challenge,&nbsp;the detection of ethical issues and biases that are inherent in digitised cultural heritage collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Three stipends of €2,500 each will be made available to the winners in order to implement their proposals and deliver the according datasets by end of June 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would like to extend our gratitude to everyone who submitted a proposal to this challenge for their hard work and excellent ideas.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cultural heritage and climate change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On March 19, the <a href=\"https://fridaysforfuture.org/march19/\">Fridays For Future Movement</a> is calling for global climate protests. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/be-part-of-europeana-network-association-action-on-climate-change\">Europeana Climate Action Group</a> feels that current political and economic measures for protecting climate, biodiversity, and human health are inadequate and lacking in urgency. In solidarity with global climate action, we are calling out to cultural heritage climate activists to push for collective climate action and focusing on steps that the sector can take to achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Climate change endangers our present and our future, and consequently our ability to share and learn from our past - as preserved in our cultural heritage - is at stake. Our profession and our institutions are at risk, when the impact of climate change is turning the world as we know it upside down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been working with members of various movements which bridge arts, culture and care for our planet, including <a href=\"https://wearemuseums.com/\">We Are Museums</a> and members of the grassroot movement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/museums4future\">Museums4Future</a>. Together we want to highlight and share the climate action work we do as cultural heritage professionals. We want to make a difference collectively, as a sector, to the fight against climate change and work together to protect our planet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Introducing a Climate Action Map</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To work towards this goal, we are supporting the launch of a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/glam-map\">Climate Action Map</a> where cultural heritage institutions and organisations can share their climate actions, whether small or large. Together with other movements and initiatives, we are mapping these climate actions because we acknowledge the special social responsibility of galleries, libraries, archives, museums, theatres, concert halls and science institutions to care for the future of our civilisation, our culture, our planet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are all aware of the many actions we can take, both on an individual level and as institutions, to inform, mediate and advocate for climate action in societal discourse. Now, it is time to share and connect our knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The map is open source and easy to use, and offers five categories of actions which&nbsp;share actions which could be taken at an institutional level, offering information and inspiration for actions which professionals can lobby for in their own cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Moving - tips on what you can do as individual climate activist</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Informing - on climate change through exhibitions, documentaries, seminars, art interventions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Debating - arranging workshops and similar activities where climate action is debated</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Changing - house policies through actions like a sustainability audit, green waste disposal, renewable energy, considering your digital footprint, green events only, a vegetarian cantine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Advocating - as political climate activist and raising your institutional voice against climate neglect&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To use the map, you click on the city where your institution is based, and the map-app will invite you to fill in a questionnaire. The answers are transformed into a colored pin on the map. Clicking on the pin will open the information up to the viewer and share climate action activities. We invite you to take part and create the map with us!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stronger together</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ENA Climate Action Group is working on this map as part of a wider group of dedicated GLAM professionals who love arts and culture and want to preserve cultural heritage. We work in communication and cultural mediation, as cataloguers, librarians, archivists, curators, data managers and many other varied roles. We all believe that as we care for the past, we must equally care for the future and protect it for the following generations and that together, our efforts are stronger. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/glam-map\">Contribute to the map</a> and help us share the actions that the cultural sector can take now to make a difference - use #NoMoreEmptyPromises&nbsp;to link up to the global movement for climate justice.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Join us on Friday 19 March when we will be holding an online meeting to improve the map, share information on suitable climate actions in input talks held by experts, and debate how to move on.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cultural-heritage-and-climate-change-tickets-145680695883\">Sign up for the event</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can also join the <a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/4181566/join/hKtDhbNYscVY\">ENA climate group on Basecamp</a> to exchange information and get support and feedback on your work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Please introduce our readers to the Khalili Collections.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Khalili Collections was born five decades ago out of the vision of our founder, the world-renowned scholar, collector and cultural philanthropist, Professor Sir Nasser D. Khalili. In the spirit of preservation and custodianship, he assembled eight of the world’s finest art collections – each on its own merit being the largest and most comprehensive of its kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together, the eight collections comprise some 35,000 magnificent works, many of which have been exhibited at prestigious institutions worldwide. Each work of art has been meticulously conserved, researched, catalogued and published as part of what is considered to be one of the most ambitious art scholarship projects in modern history. Eighty of over a hundred planned volumes have already been published, a project led by Sir David and with contributions from the world’s leading experts in each respective field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What inspired the Khalili Collections to partner with Europeana?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over a number of years, the Khalili Collections has undergone a major digitisation project in order to make its eight collections more accessible to the general public. The majority of the approximately 35,000 works in the collections have now been photographed (and in some cases filmed) in high definition. Digitised highlights can be accessed <a href=\"https://www.khalilicollections.org/\">here</a>, and most of these are either open access with a creative commons license or are in the process of becoming open access. The digital assets are used for a variety of projects such as publications and catalogues, exhibitions, websites, social media campaigns and other digital initiatives. We have since developed a strategy to leverage 21st century technology to give art lovers the optimal visual experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have long been impressed with both the content and reach of Europeana as a pioneering digital platform and educational resource. The content is beautifully presented in a manner that inspires and informs. So this partnership is an important milestone in our commitment to sharing important cultural stories via the vast&nbsp;heritage in our eight collections. We are excited by what we can&nbsp;achieve together in ensuring that as many people as possible are enriched with beauty&nbsp;from all over the world. After all, art is a universal language that transcends all boundaries!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Which areas will the partnership focus on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Khalili Collections’ strength is in its diversity – both in terms of content and ethos. We are proud to have one of the most geographically, culturally and creatively diverse collections in the world. This diversity takes many forms including culture, geography, time period, religion and artistic medium. Given that Europeana is committed to diversity and inclusion in many areas of its work, including the stories it tells, we plan to focus on enriching the content with cultural artefacts and stories from around the world that are currently less represented on the platform. Given that we have over 100 publications and five decades of expert scholarship to draw from, we have many stories to share with the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

Starting in March (as it’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/womens-history\">Women’s History Month</a>), they will each relate to a different collection, and spotlight areas where women have been predominantly involved in the creation of the artworks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, we will highlight works from our collection of Japanese Kimono, which as many know were largely produced by and for women over the last four centuries. Then, staying with Japan, we will draw attention to the remarkably intricate silk textiles produced by Japanese women during the Meiji era; textiles that are made with such precision that many of them could be confused for realist oil paintings! Moving on to a different form of the same medium, we will bring into focus our collection of Swedish textiles, which were produced by women in the region of Scania in 19th century Sweden. Finally, we will use the stories of masterpieces in our largest collection – Islamic Art – to challenge misconceptions about women in the history of Islamic culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Europeana Foundation is a beneficiary in all funded projects, joining partners from 19 EU countries. The projects will start from April 2021 and run until 2022-2023. Explore what they will achieve below!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Multilingual experience&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CEF Automated Translation 2020 call aimed to extend the provision of language resources through the <a href=\"https://www.lr-coordination.eu/\">European Language Resource Coordination’s SHARE repository</a> with the use of innovative translation tools. It also looked to integrate automated translation functionalities into other DSIs, public services or SMEs.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate</a></strong>&nbsp;project was funded under this call to optimise the multilingual experience of the Europeana website. The project will connect the Europeana and the eTranslation DSIs to allow the automatic translation of millions of records from their local language to English, improving the usability of heritage resources on Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Innovative approaches</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana 2020 CEF call aimed to continue supporting cultural heritage institutions to open their collections with the use of innovative technological approaches. The five projects funded under this call will enhance Europeana’s infrastructure by increasing high quality content and enhancing diversity and local representation in our collections. The projects funded under this call will also experiment with novel technological approaches such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve the discoverability, multilinguality, engagement and use of Europeana content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enricheuropeana\">EnrichEuropeana+</a></strong> aims to enhance the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon Platform</a> by developing and integrating new tools based on innovative artificial intelligence and natural language processing. This will help to automate transcriptions as well as support semantic enrichment and translation of metadata. The project will host participatory events to engage Europeana audiences and the general public with manuscripts from the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled</a></strong> aims to enable audiovisual media heritage from major national broadcasters from Europe to be enjoyed by professional and non-professional audiences. It will increase the use of this media through closed captioning and subtitling, as well as enabling automatic speech recognition and machine translation to produce high-quality captions and English subtitles. The project will work with educators to create learning resources with audiovisual content and focus on language learning using the Content Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted\">CRAFTED</a></strong> aims to support the transfer of European crafts to future generations by aggregating, enriching and promoting tangible crafts heritage and preserving intangible skills and knowledge from craftsmen and artisans. It will develop an innovative, human-in-the-loop methodology to support automatic enrichment at a large scale. It will provide the cultural sector with capacity building resources that support the adoption of AI-driven methods.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/jewish-history-tours\">Jewish History Tours</a></strong> aims to create engaging online tours on pan-European topics such as multiculturalism, persecution and migration. The tour production will be supported by several innovations including a Europeana-based platform for authoring tours; an AI recommendation system for authors; and a semi-automatic geographical enrichment and machine translation for multilingual tours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE</a></strong> aims to develop a framework to link the tangible and intangible heritage of cultural communities, safeguarding the rich and invaluable cultural heritage which they represent. The project will create editorials and capacity building activities to develop a closer connection between cultural heritage institutions, cultural communities and Europeana. The project will create a WEAVE Toolkit using AI and other novel technologies, which will support the use of annotations and semi-automatic recognition of specific gestures and movements, as well as the visualisation of performances and 3D models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The execution of the European Commission funded projects is overseen by the Innovation And Networks Executive Agency (INEA). Kyriaki Tragouda, Unit C5 – Telecommunications Project Manager at INEA says, 'We are excited to see how these projects will support cultural heritage institutions to make the best use of Europeana in their own public activities, as well as to open up their collections and provide high-quality engaging digital content to Europeana with the use of innovative approaches and tools.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ed267a79-7fff-e493-ccd2-cb7f7c4db44f\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-projects\">Explore more Generic Services projects on Europeana Pro</a>. </b></p>\r\n"

Coordinated by the Foundation, 21 partners work together to deliver the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-annual-report-2019-2020\">Europeana</a> service. We also participate in EU-funded projects (Generic Services and Horizon 2020 projects) to both develop the Europeana services and support cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation. The scope and partners of these projects are many and varied, covering topics from aggregation to technological innovation, audience engagement and capacity-building.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) present a host of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/exploring-ai-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">exciting opportunities</a> for GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) in the digital world. These range from the development of models or algorithms perfected through data processing, to mining, analysing and enriching datasets with new metadata. While these opportunities are likely to propel GLAMs forward through their digital transformation, they also raise questions in the area of copyright, especially when it comes to using GLAMs’ digital collections to train AI and the treatment of AI-generated outputs under copyright law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Creative Commons (CC), we are currently reflecting on some of the issues and in this post, we share our perspective on three key points: the use of collections by GLAMs for AI training;&nbsp;the copyright/public domain status of AI-generated content; and the barriers beyond copyright to opening up and sharing GLAM collections in light of the lack of clarity surrounding AI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use of GLAM collections as input for AI training</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CC fully supports GLAMs in using the massive amounts of data in their digital collections for AI-training purposes (including machine-learning) in order to <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/05/18/copyright-law-must-enable-museums-to-fulfill-their-mission/\">fulfil their public interest missions</a>. Legally, there remains significant uncertainty as to whether copyright limitations and exceptions allow the use of copyright content for AI training. This uncertainty is likely to have a chilling effect on GLAMs wishing to take advantage of AI technologies. This is one reason why, at CC, we argue that the use of copyright works to train AI should be considered non-infringing by default. As concerns <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2021/03/04/should-cc-licensed-content-be-used-to-train-ai-it-depends/\">CC-licensed content</a>, where copyright permission is required to train AI systems, the licenses grant that permission under different terms and conditions depending on the particular CC license. A <a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lTpav2w=/\">flowchart</a> helps visualise whether the licenses are triggered and if so, what conditions may apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>No copyright in AI 'creative'&nbsp;content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI has been seen to generate ‘creative’ content through processes such as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/08/10/can-machines-write-like-jane-austen/\">Markov chains and artificial neural networks</a> like GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, a deep learning model that can produce text). Such content might very well become part of GLAMs’ collections as it starts to gain appreciation as a new form of ‘creative’ expression. Likewise, the content generated by GLAMs using AI technology (like enriched datasets) is likely to become abundant as more and more institutions explore the opportunities offered by AI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the copyright status of such content is unclear under existing law, CC is of the firm view that there should be <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/02/20/cautious-approach-to-copyright-and-artificial-intelligence/\">no copyright on AI-generated content</a> and that it should be <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/08/10/no-copyright-protection-for-ai-generated-output/\">in the public domain</a>. Public domain material can be widely accessed, used and reused by GLAMs in fulfilment of their public-interest mission as well as by the general public. We <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2021/02/03/the-postal-worker-a-sea-shanty-and-the-public-domain/?fbclid=IwAR3iTI6FHdYTqw7JBfiRjO65jenKkPRxuk7fNm2WjmpQ7k4yEA8cUqHWCas\">recently stated</a> that we all benefit when knowledge, culture, and history are made accessible and shareable. That’s why, in line with the principles proclaimed in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Europeana Public Domain Charter</a>, we must <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/category/policy-advocacy-copyright-reform/\">continue to advocate</a> for open access to knowledge and culture and resist further enclosures of our shared public domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Barriers beyond copyright&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2021/03/04/should-cc-licensed-content-be-used-to-train-ai-it-depends/\">Beyond copyright</a>, several obstacles to sharing and using GLAM collections related to ethics, privacy and data protection need to be assessed to bring clarity to the rapidly evolving role that AI is playing in the GLAM sector.

        teaser: "<p>Europeana's commitment to Diversity and Inclusion translates to many different actions we will take as an organisation and around it. One of them was formalising a Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) cross-team that can structure the work across the Europeana Foundation. But what is a cross-team? How does it fit in the wider structure of the Europeana Foundation, and who is involved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Working in the cross-team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cross-team at the Europeana Foundation is made up of colleagues who&nbsp;work in&nbsp;a range of different teams across the organisation. These members come together, bringing their own expertise and perspectives,&nbsp;to ensure we collect feedback and input from the whole organisation to tackle a specific goal, project, or ambition area of strategic importance. In January 2021, we established the Diversity and Inclusion cross-team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Up to this point, our work to&nbsp;further&nbsp;diversity and inclusion in the Foundation&nbsp;was mostly ad-hoc, scattered across different teams, and sometimes not proactively communicated to the rest of the organisation or external partners. For example: the Collections Engagement team focused on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women's History Month</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/black-history\">Black History Month</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/lgbtq\">Pride Month</a> in their editorial last year; the Service Experience team worked towards increasing the accessibility of our platforms; and the Community and Partner Engagement team worked on inclusiveness in our events. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-sense-making-workshops-findings-and-outcomes\">The Digital Transformation Sense making workshops</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2020-we-re-looking-for-your-contribution\">themed call for proposals for Europeana 2020</a> and our work with the New Professionals Task Force gave us lots of data and food for thought to work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2021, we formalised this Diversity and Inclusion Cross team, which currently consists of 14 members. The team creates structure for&nbsp;these tasks and supports goals that span&nbsp;the different teams of the Foundation. We aim to be transparent, both within and outside of the Foundation. We organise and structure the work that each team does on D&amp;I so that we can work towards attaining our shared goals together.&nbsp;Julia Fallon, manager of the Community and Partner Engagement team, reports the progress of this team regularly to Harry Verwayen, Europeana's Executive Director, and more formally to the Management team monthly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Meet the D&amp;I cross-team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost every team within the organisation is represented in the D&amp;I cross-team, and each member joined the team because they feel the need to not only improve their knowledge on this topic but also change their working environment for the better. The cross-team is chaired by Jolan Wuyts and Marijke Everts and co-chaired by Gina van der Linden, who share a few words&nbsp;explaining why this work is important to them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marijke Everts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My colleague Isabel Crespo and I started talking about diversity and inclusion because we were disappointed in the lack of diversity in the editorials we were producing and wanted to do so much more. We raised this with the rest of the Collections Engagement team who were on board, especially Jolan Wuyts who started to take an active role with us. I then started to talk to Julia Fallon who manages the Community and Partner Engagement team because I heard she was taking action in this area, and began discussions with Henning Scholz, who manages the Data Partner Services team, because I wanted to see how we could bring in more diverse content. I also reached out to Dasha Moskalenko who manages the Service Experience team because I was curious about language sensitivity and how accessible our platform was/is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These initial conversations became bigger discussions because we realised the importance of working across diversity and inclusion across the whole Initiative, from what we do in our teams, to our network and partner cultural heritage institutions, and how we work and behave as individuals; there is a lot of normalised behaviour to dismantle. It’s a lot of work when you are starting from the bottom, but I also feel very lucky to be working on this with motivated and supportive colleagues who have similar goals, see why this is important and aren’t afraid to challenge the status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jolan Wuyts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My activism had mostly confined itself to my personal life over the past few years, and had only come through in my work now and then when choosing topics to focus on in the editorials I wrote. When colleagues of mine started to work on D&amp;I tasks in 2020, I wanted to learn how to contribute towards more diversity and inclusion in my workplace as well. I've supported Marijke Everts and Isabel Crespo from the Collections Engagement team in their D&amp;I work throughout 2020, which has made me realise how much work still can be done both in the organisation and in my personal development. I've committed myself to more involvement in D&amp;I work across the Foundation in 2021. I'm passionate about helping and supporting others, and enabling Europeana to be a platform where underrepresented voices can be heard and tell their stories is an important way for me to enact that support. I'm also looking forward to learning, together with the rest of the organisation, how we can recognise and dismantle our own biases, and learn to build new structures that are more progressive, open-minded&nbsp;and caring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gina van der Linden</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For me, as an event manager, it is important to make sure all our guests feel welcome, safe and ‘at home’ at our events; this is what hospitality means to me and what makes me happy. Organising events online however has created a whole new world as webinars and meetings are more accessible than ever before. As a result of this, meetings and webinars aren’t necessarily a safe place to come together and have discussions. But we do need those safe spaces for our communities and to be able to achieve this, we require guidance and support from D&amp;I consultants to train us and help us draft guidelines for future events. It won’t happen overnight but we are working on it and together we will do our utmost to become a better, more open and safe place to anyone. I am looking forward to being part of it!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>At Europeana 2019, you will have the opportunity to work with and learn from leading specialists, practitioners and researchers from across the world. The programme is being designed to enable you to learn new things, inform yourself and get inspired. How?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Attend workshops to learn new skills and approaches to implement in your job.</li>\r\n    <li>Hear the latest news, updates and use-cases surrounding the hottest topics in our sector.</li>\r\n    <li>Engage with the innovations and technologies that will transform the future.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nDraft programme and five session details released</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, we announced that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2019-meet-our-speakers-frederic-kaplan\">Frederic Kaplan will be one of Europeana 2019’s keynote speakers</a>. Today, we’re delighted to release the draft programme, giving you a sneak peek at how the event is shaping up. We are also sharing a more detailed look at some of the first sessions - we hope you’re as excited about them as we are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to implement the FAIR principles in digital culture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you work with FAIR - the set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable? How do you deal with the tech issues that the implementation of FAIR principles poses to your organisation? Did you know that FAIR will be really valuable if your institution decides to join the European Open Science Cloud?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this session, you will discuss practical issues related to FAIR implementation across the cultural heritage and research sectors. Saskia Scheltjens, head of Research Services at the Rijksmuseum, will talk about the implementation of FAIR data principles in a large art historical museum. Drawing on his experience leading a working group on FAIR within the Research Data Alliance, Makx Dekkers will discuss crucial aspects of evaluating the ‘FAIRness’ of your data. A panel discussion will follow and we look forward to hearing your voice there! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shaping the future of&nbsp;education with cultural heritage&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know how to build 21st-century skills like critical thinking and media literacy with digital cultural heritage? Are you a cultural heritage professional interested in how your collections can be used in innovative ways by educators?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This panel session will showcase how Europeana, together with leaders in innovative learning (European Schoolnet, EUROCLIO), is mainstreaming the use of digital cultural heritage in education and its impact among students. We’ll discuss key issues including the importance of high-quality source material, where to find training tools and ready-to-use resources for educators, how to ensure community involvement and how collaborations between cultural heritage institutions and educators can promote the use of collections in European classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speakers: Steven Steger, Executive Director at EUROCLIO, Agueda Gras-Velazquez, Head of the Science Education Department at European Schoolnet and Marco Neves, Europeana Teacher Ambassador for Portugal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Promoting cultural heritage with Digital Invasion&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you want to learn how to use digital tools to tell stories collectively? Are you an educator looking for active (and unconventional) ways to engage students with cultural heritage material?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then join us for a Europeana 2019 digital invasion - the cultural heritage experience in which people armed with smartphones, cameras and video cameras come together to create both a physical and social media cultural moment! This session will introduce the concept of a digital invasion and how it can be used to connect a range of audiences with culture. Then come with us as we perform our own digital invasion in Lisbon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nMultilingual access and machine translation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Are your digital services open to a global audience? Could richer multilingual support attract new users?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multilingualism and linguistic diversity have always been part of the reality of the European Union. This session will share key learnings and outputs from the recent Finnish Presidency event on multilinguality for digital cultural heritage. Looking at multilingual metadata, content translation and user interactions, you will explore the opportunities and benefits of multilingualism in digital cultural heritage, and pathways to solving the problems associated with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nCommunicating the value of digital culture to stakeholders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you engage with high-level stakeholders? Are you confident you understand what they need to know and how that relates to, and can help you promote your organisation’s objectives and the value of cultural heritage?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To inform their decision-making, stakeholders in the cultural heritage sector need information about the value and impact of the sector’s activities. In this session, you’ll look at how to translate the value of your activities into communications that are relevant to and support your stakeholders’ agendas. Build your confidence in engaging with stakeholders by joining in a practical workshop, focusing on using clear statements and evidence to communicate coherently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<br />\r\nFind out more and book now!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the programme is subject to change - we’ll be adding to and refining it throughout the summer so visit our event page to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-2019\">find out more about Europeana 2019, see the draft programme and book your tickets</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In this interview series, we get a glimpse into the researchers’ academic lives, their goals, and the influence of digital cultural heritage on their work. The third grant winner in this series is Dr Berber Hagedoorn, Assistant Professor in Media Studies at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Her project supported by Europeana resulted in a detailed analysis and research model of user engagement and interaction with the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection, entitled 'Creative Reuse and Storytelling with Europeana 1914-1918'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is your current academic position and what is your research focus?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I'm an Assistant Professor in Media Studies at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and my research interests revolve around audiovisual culture, its creative reuse and storytelling. My research starts from my personal fascination with the role of (audio)visual media as a storyteller, and how this role has amplified across platforms and screens in the digital age. Right now, more data, people and digital tools than ever before are involved in creative processes of storytelling, reflecting national and global identities and cultures. Such meaning-making is in large part scattered across platforms. \r\n<div><img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-07/Photo Berber Hagedoorn.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\" />\r\nI am keen for my research to help in making these interpretations of reality – which importantly contribute to cultural memory formation in modern societies – more transparent. In this context, Digital Humanities can offer new opportunities for Humanities research, as well as help to question the value or limitations of data science methods.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

                body: "<p><em>Photograph by Sebastiaan ter Burg</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the research project 'Creative Reuse and Storytelling with Europeana 1914-1918', we studied how data science methodologies can provide new contextualisation for textual and (audio)visual content, by: (1) selecting and collecting data (scraping the site of the collection); (2) translating descriptions from the different languages in the 1914-1918 Collection into English (both automatically and manually); (3) conducting sentiment analysis of the items’ descriptions; (4) topic modelling (both automatic and manual); and finally, (5) annotating via both manual labelling and unsupervised machine learning for clustering data (automated labelling), to offer new labels as contextualisation for storytelling and creative reuse with the collection. Such steps also included some statistical text analysis and visualisation of the results. The project underscores and provides tangible examples of how machine-learning techniques alone are not always enough to provide accurate results context-wise. The domain knowledge of the annotator is essential to the process of carrying out a complete and concrete task (for example in topic modelling), as the project demonstrates by means of specific case studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate qualitative methods for user studies, which help to understand specific user perspectives. Therefore, co-creative focus groups with specific search tasks allowed for specific insights into how researchers evaluate the role of creative reuse and storytelling, when doing research into historical events and personal perspectives of World War I with the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection. As a result, my project provides insights into how this collection 'affords' creative reuse and storytelling by researchers – both scholars and media professionals – as platform users. It especially offers deeper understandings of Europeana Collections as a creative storytelling platform: how the 1914-1918 Collection as linked (open) data can reveal 'hidden' archival stories, brought forth by cross-collection. Ultimately, it provides models suitable for exploring and contextualising Europeana Collections further.</p>\r\n"

Furthermore, documentalists or users describing an item may be more removed in terms of space and time from the personal story or perspective present in the historical source, which often leads to descriptions using more 'neutral' language, especially for audiovisual content. This is why the following questions were deemed relevant in this project: can data science offer opportunities to bring emotion 'back' into these sources?; and, can user analysis help here to better understand the value of such personal narratives in digital(ised) cultural heritage for creative reuse, storytelling and research?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By means of the research project 'Creative Reuse and Storytelling with Europeana 1914-1918' I performed a pilot study combining data science methods with qualitative analysis and user studies around linked (open) data, enabling me to observe platform engagement and interaction. As a result, this project has mapped out requirements for creative reuse and storytelling with the 1914-1918 Collection. It provides a research model to study engagement when using the platform, and thus studying in practice and in interaction how users and technologies co-construct meaning.</p>\r\n"

I have extensive experience in Media and Culture Studies and Digital Humanities through other large-scale Dutch and European best-practice projects on digital heritage and cultural memory, including VideoActive and CLARIAH. I decided to apply for the Europeana Research Grants Programme because in my previous work I have extensively studied the multimedia storytelling and reuse of audiovisual archival materials of World War II, especially in historical and archive-based television and cross-media content. I was therefore very keen and enthusiastic to be able to expand this work in the context of the 1914-1918 Collection, and to carry out a pilot study combining data science and qualitative analysis to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I argue that creative reuse with digital cultural heritage not only offers new possibilities for Humanities research, but is also important from a meta-perspective in two key ways. Firstly,&nbsp; it can provide self-reflexive perspectives regarding search and doing research, such as individual skills and practices of search or research (‘search cultures’), as well as personal interests and ‘information bubbles’ in digital contexts. I believe that awareness of these aspects can positively influence the way in which we use digital tools, and write up and share our findings in research. Secondly, creative reuse is practical as a main research perspective, because it underscores that the selection of historical sources as digital cultural heritage in a database adds other – more or less visible – layers of representation and interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about Dr Hagedoorn's project, download her final report below, and read the other interviews in this series with grant winners <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/exploring-autobiographical-writings-from-prisoners-of-war-saverio-vita-europeana-research-grants-winner\">Saverio Vita</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/interactive-mapping-of-memories-elizabeth-benjamin\">Elizabeth Benjamin</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The European Commission is preparing the implementation of Horizon Europe, the EU’s next funding programme for research and innovation to succeed the current Horizon 2020 programme. The process will help shape European research and innovation investments in the coming years. As part of the process, the Commission has launched an online consultation to collect input from across Europe and beyond. You can participate as an individual, as a representative of a single organisation or as a representative of a group of organisations. The inputs received will inform the work to prepare a ‘Strategic Plan’ for Horizon Europe, which will then guide the work programmes and calls for proposals for Horizon Europe’s first four years (2021-2024).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Culture and creativity are part of Horizon Europe</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Horizon Europe covers a huge range of issues (from health to terrorism, and from climate change to space technology), one of its six clusters of activities is focused on culture, creativity and inclusive society. This is significant as culture is being given a much greater emphasis and visibility than it had under the previous programme, Horizon 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The extensive <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/pdf/horizon-europe/ec_rtd_orientations-towards-the-strategic-planning.pdf\">consultation document</a> (go to Annexe 2 - page 50 for the culture section), explains that, ‘historical sites and monuments, cultural landscapes, artefacts, museums, archives, as well as languages, customs, traditions, and values all make up the rich tapestry of European cultural heritage. This makes Europe a vibrant and unique place to tackle future challenges based on its creativity, excellent research, sustainable cultural tourism and cutting-edge technologies.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report reflects a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=digital+transformation\">recent theme on Europeana Pro</a> - that with a view to creating jobs, growth and wealth, cultural heritage ‘needs to make the best use of the opportunities brought by the digital transformation. It needs to combine traditional craftsmanship, cutting edge and digital technologies for the preservation and restauration [sic] of cultural goods with innovative techniques in the cultural and creative industries’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inclusion of culture within Horizon Europe is important for the future of the sector and has far-reaching potential. The report suggests that the cultural and creative sectors should be integrated into research and innovation processes (something that Europeana is also actively advocating for in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-innovation-agenda\">Europeana Innovation Agenda</a>) and make use of the ongoing big data revolution in the social sciences and the humanities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to make your voice heard</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The online consultation will help Horizon Europe to prioritise its actions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have your say and voice your thoughts about the role that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative sectors can play under Horizon Europe by taking part in the consultation. Use the free text fields in the appropriate survey questions to advocate for the importance of digital culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The consultation will close on 8 September 2019.&nbsp;</em> <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/HorizonEurope_Codesign_2021-2024\">Go to the Open Consultation now</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why we’ve been testing GIFT</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best way to explain the GIFT web app is that it’s like making a playlist or a mixtape for someone, except with objects from a museum instead of music tracks. Basically you can pick any object in the museum and use your smartphone to create a digital gift for someone you care about. I think it has huge potential in rethinking the way digital technology can shape a museum visit. Most visitors come to our museums with relatives, partners, friends, or as part of a group. For these people, the museum visit is clearly a social experience. Yet this is often overlooked by digital offerings in museums, which are designed for a solitary user. Audio guides speak directly into an individual’s ears; interactive touchscreens can usually only be used by one person at a time. These technologies can be effective ways of providing more content to visitors, but they often rub against the grain of the social experience, resulting in a low uptake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the surface, GIFT does much the same: the visitor uses their mobile phone to create and share content in a solitary way. But because it is so rooted in the practice of creating and sending gifts, it can enhance the museum’s social experience. A gift could be sent to a friend in another gallery of the museum, who is then encouraged to seek out the shared exhibit. It can even be shared with someone outside of the museum, so that they can enjoy their gift at home, and possibly visit the museum themselves in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>GIFT vs Social</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You could argue that GIFT is simply replicating what social media platforms already enable. Thousands of people every year are creating and sharing photos of their museum using familiar tools such as Facebook and Instagram. Why should any museum visitor use a new application like GIFT for this purpose? There are several answers to this question, but for me there are two powerful reasons why GIFT can enable a much richer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social media channels like Twitter and Facebook are based on a model of the one speaking to the many. This changes the way people communicate. When you compose a tweet, you are likely thinking of the tens, hundreds, or thousands of followers you might have, and will shape your language accordingly (for better or worse). Whether you’re showing off, being cautiously diplomatic, purposely aggressive, or conspicuously polite, the way you communicate will be inherently performative. As a result, these channels are not ideal for communicating more nuanced messages, or sharing ideas that only make sense within more intimate relationships. If you spot a painting that reminds you of a long-deceased aunt’s dog, is Instagram the best place to share that with your cousin?</p>\r\n"

As these feeds are often noisy, even a thoughtfully crafted message will quickly get lost on a long timeline. By turning an ephemeral message into a gift, Blast Theory’s GIFT app taps into the long-established practice of museum visitors acquiring souvenirs of their experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Postcards of the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GIFT reminds me of a much older form of social technology: the postcard. The development of the postcard in the early 1900s was a stepping stone to how we communicate with social media today, as they enabled rapid communication through images and short-form text. Unlike social media, however, postcards were designed for one-to-one communication, and this encouraged the use of them for more personal and intimate communications. Take this 1905 example from our collections:</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Aside from enabling rapid and personalised communication, people often kept postcards, as souvenirs and mementos of places and people. That is why this postcard, and thousands of others, have ended up in our collections. (We have over 7,000 in our collections, including 1,000 that you can <a href=\"https://dams-brightonmuseums.org.uk/assetbank-pavilion/action/browseItems?categoryId=1902&amp;categoryTypeId=1\">view and download online</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For all its speed and ease of use, digital media is not very good at providing long-lasting mementos of shared experiences. GIFT gets as close as any digital medium I have seen to recapturing what has made postcards so popular for over a century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve extended the run of the GIFT web app at Brighton Museum until 6 October 2019, and the feedback received from visitors will inform the future of the app. By showing that digital technology can be used to reframe the social experience of the museum visit, and not simply provide a conduit for more content about the displays, GIFT already shows a new direction of travel. Even if it does not create the museum of the future, it may very well provide a postcard for the Instagram generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you can’t visit Brighton you can test the apps developed as part of GIFT and hear more about the project at Europeana 2019 this autumn. On Wednesday 27 November, members of the GIFT project will spend the day showcasing the tools -&nbsp;you can get involved by <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2019-connect-communities-tickets-61030544000\">booking your ticket</a> to Europeana 2019. I’ll be there and will be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><em>To find out more about the project and to download tools and apps please visit the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/\">GIFT project</a>.

        title: 'Professionals in Focus: Tamara Butigan, Head of the Digital Library Department at the National Library of Serbia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Are you interested in the unusual and complex jobs in digital cultural heritage? So are we. So each month we are going to take a deep dive into the work of professionals in the sector. This time, we speak with Members Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/tamara-butigan\">Tamara Butigan</a> about the mines of Bor and her enthusiasm for digitisation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>About Tamara...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With my background in electrical engineering, I started working as a subject librarian in the <a href=\"https://www.nb.rs\">National Library of Serbia</a>, which opened up a whole new world for me. Over the course of these 20+ years with the National Library, I’ve worked as a webmaster, head of digital library, European projects coordinator and assistant, head of international cooperation and deputy director. Three years ago I resumed my role as head of the digital library. The pursuit of new challenges brought me to Europeana’s door, where I’m still busy discovering. It helps me to remain a Eurooptimist in the Eurosceptic, non-EU part of Europe.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main projects we are working on here is a new digital library portal, with a fresh graphical solution, a new way to organise digital documents, and a separate website for editorials - ‘une belle découverte’ for us, resulting from two Europeana projects: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">The Rise of Literacy</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/migration-in-the-arts-and-science\">Migration in the Arts and Sciences</a>. At the same time, we are working on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture project</a> by applying the aggregation landscape for Europeana in Serbia. I am very excited about the editorials on industrial heritage that we are creating together with the Public Library Bor, highlighting the mines of Bor, dating from the 19th century. An important part of my work relates to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/serbia-launches-new-heritage-aggregator-for-europeana\">national aggregator for Europeana</a> that we set up in 2018 with our Slovenian partner Semantika. Together with the national coordinator of <a href=\"https://www.dariah.eu/network/partners-countries/serbia/\">DARIAH Serbia</a>, we are planning digital humanities activities for 2020.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest challenge and issue in my role is working with people who do not share the same enthusiasm for digitisation, or for European projects and values. But that’s also a great motivation to persevere. The constant lack of IT specialists affects our everyday work and is a huge challenge too. I prefer to work in a team, especially brainstorming, but I also enjoy getting my hands dirty with metadata from time to time.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the Europeana Network Association, I attended a series of AGMs and as a rule, these events were among the most interesting in my travel agenda. So I wanted to play a more active role in the Network, which coincided with the proposal by Europeana for people to stand for elections. And here I am, the only councillor coming from a non-EU country, which makes me responsible for bringing Europeana closer to this corner of Europe and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My dedication to digital humanities has already been expressed among the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/research-community\">Europeana Research Community</a>. I am active in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/research-requirements\">Europeana Research Requirements Task Force</a>, trying at the same time to act locally, by working on Serbian digital collections to ensure they are DH-driven. As a kind of Europeana ambassador, I will work on promoting everything Europeana is, both locally and regionally. In particular, I’ll work on attracting Serbian CHIs to deliver quality data through the aggregator for Europeana at the National Library of Serbia.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>A webinar open to all</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hosted by Europeana Communicators, a specialist community of the Europeana Network Association, but open to all to attend, this ‘Solve-It Session’ is an hour-long webinar to help participants promote digital cultural heritage by sharing knowledge, tools and best practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is digital storytelling?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital storytelling is the practice of using computer-based tools to tell stories. It is a term often used to demonstrate the democracy of our modern world - everyone has a story to tell and almost everyone has access to the tools (like computers, mobile phones equipped with cameras, video and audio) to both share and consume stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the cultural heritage sector, digital storytelling is important - it offers new and useful ways for audiences from students and learners to culture lovers and tourists to experience, interact with and enjoy cultural heritage. Our first Solve-It-Session introduces two very different approaches to bringing audiences and culture closer together.</p>\r\n"

This is long-form storytelling - so far, Federica has produced 32&nbsp;hour-long episodes, including one with Europeana’s Harry Verwayen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marianna Marcucci will talk to us about <a href=\"https://www.invasionidigitali.it/\">Invasioni Digitali</a> - the cultural heritage experience she has pioneered in which people armed with smartphones, cameras and video cameras come together to create both a physical and social media cultural moment. This is an immediate, collaborative and perhaps unconventional approach to storytelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Then it’s over to you</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll hear from these experts and then, moderated by Europeana Communicators co-chair Susan Hazan, you will have the opportunity to ask questions (we’ll talk you through how at the start of the session) or discuss your own issues and ideas on the theme of digital storytelling for cultural heritage with other participants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about our speakers, look out for interviews with them on Europeana Pro News later this month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet Technoculture’s Federica Bressan - Europeana Communicators’ Solve-It-Session speaker #1'
        posttype: News

        intro: "<p>On Friday 13 September at 10:00 CEST, Europeana Communicators, a specialist community of the Europeana Network Association, presents a ‘Solve-It Session’ on digital storytelling. This hour-long webinar helps participants promote digital cultural heritage by sharing knowledge, tools and best practices. Today, we meet one of the session’s speakers - Federica Bressan, an academic researcher and the power behind the <a href=\"http://technoculture-podcast.com\">Technoculture</a> podcast.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>What is Technoculture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technoculture is a series of one-on-one conversations with experts in the fields of technology, art, and science. Together we explore how digital technology influences our lives, our experiences, and ultimately what it means to be human today.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see the podcast as a platform to foster an intelligent discussion around topics that concern our contemporary society. There is a demand for sophisticated content: mainstream media seem to assume that the audience has a very short attention span, but actually, there is a hunger for long-format discussions on complex themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first episode of Technoculture was released on 28 October 2018, the international day of cultural heritage, and there are 32 episodes out to date and is\_available on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, and all major platforms.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you get into podcasting?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017-2018, I was travelling world-wide for my Marie Curie research project. I was meeting people from all walks of life with whom I was having fascinating discussions. Some were so interesting I thought it was a shame I couldn’t share them with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, I was an avid podcast listener, and I spent a few months contemplating how we’re rediscovering the power of the spoken word. With a podcast, your words reach very far instantly through the internet, but they are also persistent like the written word used to be. You can play the audio back on your personal device, anytime, anywhere, while you’re commuting or doing chores. There’s something powerful and unprecedented about this way of circulating knowledge.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So after caressing the idea for a while, I decided to go for it and start my own podcast. I already knew what I wanted to talk about and who I wanted to interview. It was a matter of learning how to actually produce a podcast. I won’t say it’s been easy, but on the other side of the first season with 30+ episodes, I can say that it’s the best thing I’ve done in a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you have any advice for would-be podcasters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think twice before you commit. You’ll be surprised by the amount of time and resources that it takes to produce your first podcast. We already have cemeteries of podcasts out there. Does the world need one more podcast? Maybe not. But if you have a vision about your podcast, if it’s calling you, and you have a spark in your eyes when you talk about it, then go for it. And have fun doing it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting it up, getting on iTunes etc. is easier than I thought in the beginning, but it also takes more time than I thought. I take care of every step in the production of my podcast (except the mastering, outsourced to Federico Pelle of The Basement Group in Italy), and the task that takes the longest is editing the episode after the recording, even for me with a background in audio.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, make it easy for people to find you – make your podcast available on every platform you can. And forget monetisation. Your podcast is your hobby.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you share some of the highlights of the series?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight has to be <a href=\"http://podcast.federicabressan.com/michael-matlosz.php\">Michael Matlosz, the President of EuroScience</a>. This was the first episode I released. Talking to him set me a higher challenge, it raised the bar for the entire series.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was very pleased to talk to <a href=\"http://podcast.federicabressan.com/europeana.php\">Harry Verwayen</a> to get to grips with Europeana – an ambitious project that has recently celebrated ten years of activity, and keeps leading the European cultural scene with original initiatives and events, bringing us citizens closer to our heritage. I am a huge fan of Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also a thrill to talk to world advocate on transhumanism, <a href=\"http://podcast.federicabressan.com/zoltan-istvan.php\">Zoltan Istvan</a>. He’s been a National Geographic journalist, author, entrepreneur, and he ran for US president and governor of California.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\n<br>\r\nWith such diverse contributors, are there any common themes?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than a theme, the podcast has an interest in exploring in 360 degrees the impact that digital technology has on our lives and our society. The common denominator is an interest in the Human, and how the experience of being in the world changes as new technology emerges, and people depend on and merge with machines.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as the guests, they all share a genuine passion for their topic, regardless of the field of specialization. Even if they talk about different aspects of digital tech, they all show a keen sensibility for how humans are impacted or engage with whatever it is they are experts in. The mission of the podcast is not just to explain frontier tech, but to tell the story of the people who make it, receive it, and conceptualise it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We're delighted to have you present at the Europeana Communicators Solve-It-Session - what can we expect to hear from you then?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that podcasts are meant to be available as permanent resources and are part of an ongoing conversation - the storytelling must be long-term. In that context, I’ll introduce Technoculture and talk about some of the decisions I had to make, from the high-level goals and the choice of guests to the practical elements like the format, the length, and whether or not to include video. And disclose some new ideas for the upcoming second season...</p>\r\n"

        title: 'TEST 1: Europeana Education MOOC: Giving teachers confidence to use digital cultural heritage'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The \_Europeana Education MOOC, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/europeana-in-your-classroom-building-21st-century-competences-with-digital-cultural-heritage\">Europeana in your classroom</a>’, delivered by European Schoolnet (EUN), ran between 30 April – 15 June 2018. The course introduced participants to the Europeana platform to help them build learning scenarios using digital culture and fostering the 21st-century skills.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over 6.5 weeks and five modules, the course offered tested classroom activities using 1) a range of educational resources produced by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mainstreaming-the-use-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-education\">Developer Group</a> (DG), and 2) a range of Europeana tools and resources (Europeana collections, curated datasets or apps among others).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Europeana in your classroom’ course content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students learnt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Why it is important to integrate European cultural heritage in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) \_How to use Europeana Collections to teach their subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) \_How to navigate the Europeana Collections website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) How to explore and familiarise themselves with the various Europeana apps, tools and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) \_How to build learning activities using Europeana Collections resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Over 2,000 registrants from 59 countries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate the success of the MOOC, EUN compiled data from two sources: (1) course registration and participation (started/completed); and (2) data collected via two surveys completed voluntarily by participants before and after the course. The surveys provided information about the profile of course participants, their motivations for joining the course, and the participants’ course impressions and satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Europeana in your classroom’ got a high number of registrants (2,019 people) from 59 different countries across the globe, which indicates a clear interest in integrating digital cultural heritage in education. The course also had a satisfactory engagement rate of almost 50% (990 participants) and a completion rate of 35% (342 participants), exceeding the MOOC average of 10%.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"280\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hhXlW7uKe1YRs8prKoijPWM3qd1HhCD91QuKJt2Iuog1IRo8TawT1Ck3mx9AIUEPOnZRwlCJ1RRc7KDpDyP3rrYOOqre2AOPu2VjPzE4wTtc8EoBm2aa8yJa8nw9XOKYd6neVTWm\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participant Map. Schoolnet Academy. CCO</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data collected via pre-course surveys (n=719) indicates that the majority of course participants are secondary school teachers (60%), and female (82%). 70% of participants are over 36 years old. Among their main motivations to participate, bringing innovation into their practice came out top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Feedback from happy teachers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-course survey results (n=271) showed that more than 95% of survey respondents rated the overall value of the course as ‘Good’ or ‘Very good’. 95% of the survey respondents also ‘Agreed’ or ‘Strongly agreed’ that the course has made them more confident in using digital cultural heritage in their classroom and that they would recommend this course to a colleague or friend. A large number of posts on the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EuropeanaInYourClassroom/\">group page</a> shows the satisfaction of the participants. Some of them said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Thank you European Schoolnet Academy and to all my peers! I had such a wonderful adventure, learning and exploring from the very beginning to the end of this course!! Mirela</em>.\_Mela Price (3 July)<br><br><em>Thank you Academy, moderators and all of the involved teachers for a great experience in this course!! Best wishes from Orhaneli-Bursa/Turkey, have a nice holiday!</em>\_Esra Demirhan Eroğlu (26 June)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers also had the opportunity to suggest improvements for future editions of the course and there was a clear consensus for finding more translated material and more practical examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to include their suggestions and continue exploiting the clear benefits of the course, the MOOC developed during Europeana DSI-3 will be updated by incorporating the learning scenarios produced throughout the DSI-4 period, and run twice in English (January 2019/January 2020). Additionally, the MOOC will be translated and run in two additional languages in 2019 and two further languages in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in the course and don’t want to miss the next editions, follow our news and updates by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\">joining\_our Europeana Education Community</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The \_Europeana Education MOOC, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/europeana-in-your-classroom-building-21st-century-competences-with-digital-cultural-heritage\">Europeana in your classroom</a>’, delivered by European Schoolnet (EUN), ran between 30 April – 15 June 2018. The course introduced participants to the Europeana platform to help them build learning scenarios using digital culture and fostering the 21st-century skills.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over 6.5 weeks and five modules, the course offered tested classroom activities using 1) a range of educational resources produced by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mainstreaming-the-use-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-education\">Developer Group</a> (DG), and 2) a range of Europeana tools and resources (Europeana collections, curated datasets or apps among others).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Europeana in your classroom’ course content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students learnt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Why it is important to integrate European cultural heritage in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) \_How to use Europeana Collections to teach their subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) \_How to navigate the Europeana Collections website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) How to explore and familiarise themselves with the various Europeana apps, tools and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) \_How to build learning activities using Europeana Collections resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Over 2,000 registrants from 59 countries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate the success of the MOOC, EUN compiled data from two sources: (1) course registration and participation (started/completed); and (2) data collected via two surveys completed voluntarily by participants before and after the course. The surveys provided information about the profile of course participants, their motivations for joining the course, and the participants’ course impressions and satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Europeana in your classroom’ got a high number of registrants (2,019 people) from 59 different countries across the globe, which indicates a clear interest in integrating digital cultural heritage in education. The course also had a satisfactory engagement rate of almost 50% (990 participants) and a completion rate of 35% (342 participants), exceeding the MOOC average of 10%.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"280\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hhXlW7uKe1YRs8prKoijPWM3qd1HhCD91QuKJt2Iuog1IRo8TawT1Ck3mx9AIUEPOnZRwlCJ1RRc7KDpDyP3rrYOOqre2AOPu2VjPzE4wTtc8EoBm2aa8yJa8nw9XOKYd6neVTWm\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participant Map. Schoolnet Academy. CCO</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data collected via pre-course surveys (n=719) indicates that the majority of course participants are secondary school teachers (60%), and female (82%). 70% of participants are over 36 years old. Among their main motivations to participate, bringing innovation into their practice came out top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Feedback from happy teachers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-course survey results (n=271) showed that more than 95% of survey respondents rated the overall value of the course as ‘Good’ or ‘Very good’. 95% of the survey respondents also ‘Agreed’ or ‘Strongly agreed’ that the course has made them more confident in using digital cultural heritage in their classroom and that they would recommend this course to a colleague or friend. A large number of posts on the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EuropeanaInYourClassroom/\">group page</a> shows the satisfaction of the participants. Some of them said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Thank you European Schoolnet Academy and to all my peers! I had such a wonderful adventure, learning and exploring from the very beginning to the end of this course!! Mirela</em>.\_Mela Price (3 July)<br><br><em>Thank you Academy, moderators and all of the involved teachers for a great experience in this course!! Best wishes from Orhaneli-Bursa/Turkey, have a nice holiday!</em>\_Esra Demirhan Eroğlu (26 June)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers also had the opportunity to suggest improvements for future editions of the course and there was a clear consensus for finding more translated material and more practical examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to include their suggestions and continue exploiting the clear benefits of the course, the MOOC developed during Europeana DSI-3 will be updated by incorporating the learning scenarios produced throughout the DSI-4 period, and run twice in English (January 2019/January 2020). Additionally, the MOOC will be translated and run in two additional languages in 2019 and two further languages in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in the course and don’t want to miss the next editions, follow our news and updates by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\">joining\_our Europeana Education Community</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The answer may vary depending on who you talk to, since it’s a narrative form that’s been adopted by everyone from individuals to cultural organisations to brands to government institutions — who all look at it from different perspectives and&nbsp;use it in so many different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially it is the same, age-old tradition of storytelling we’ve always known, but brought to life using computer-based tools and potentially delivered via a huge variety of online or multimedia formats. It distinguishes itself from classic storytelling in that it represents the democratisation of the modern world, where anyone with a computer or mobile device can tell their story, using any number of social media, podcast or other online platforms. We’re living in an unprecedented age of cultural participation and digital storytelling has become an important part of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some examples from a Europeana perspective - think <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\">online exhibitions</a> that use narrative text to&nbsp;weave together curated content - images, texts, video - on a particular topic, the latest being <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">Heritage at Risk</a>. Or <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/11-11-memories-retold\">11-11:&nbsp;Memories Retold</a>, a video game using Europeana 1914-1918 content to bring&nbsp;a more personal touch to the history of war. Or a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/steam-engine-video-project-wins-the-europeana-stem-challenge\">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;using digital cultural content in videos aimed at students, exploring the importance of the steam engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Social media and smartphones changed everything</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While digital storytelling as a technique dates back to the 90s, its widespread use exploded in the age of social media and smartphones. Suddenly with a camera and editing apps at our fingertips, overnight all of us became photographers and videographers, with mobile access to the internet from most corners of the planet. And with the rapid and near-global adoption of Facebook (and the countless other social media sites it inspired), we all became diarists and commentators, with an individual platform from which to share our stories - bypassing the previous publishing gatekeepers of editors and producers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice of media, device and platform has proliferated, giving us a wide variety of options, but in the end, once you peel back the tech veneer, it’s still about telling a story. We’re simply using different tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does it mean for cultural heritage?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While it can be argued that a lot of user-generated content out there on the internet may not merit a cultural heritage tag, there’s no denying the turning of tables that’s occurred. Whereas designated individuals used to decide what could be considered culture, in the last two decades we have collectively and democratically created a vast and ever-growing digital culture that is our heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, it’s still true that some stories speak to us more than others, which comes across in part from our likes, follows, views and shares. So in this series, we’ll be featuring the stories of a few individuals utilising digital storytelling in a variety of creative ways that we think are worth sharing. Be sure to look out for their stories in the coming days and weeks - and register for our Solve-It-Session - an hour-long webinar hosted by Europeana Communicators on digital storytelling on Friday 13 September at 10:00 CEST.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is this report and where&nbsp;is it from?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every two years, the European Commission reports on the progress made by Member States in the European Union against its policy for digital cultural heritage. The 70-page <a href=\"https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ReportonCulturalHeritageDigitisationOnlineAccessibilityandDigitalPreservation.pdf\">Cultural Heritage: Digitisation, Online Accessibility and Digital Preservation</a> report looks at progress made between 2015 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jargon check - when we talk about ‘Member States’, we’re talking about each of the 28 countries of the European Union. The report looks at how they set the priorities and directions, and support the work done by cultural heritage institutions in their countries through their ministries of culture. The areas they choose to focus on vary from country to country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European collaboration is vital to safeguarding our cultural heritage. By working towards the same Europe-wide recommendations for digital culture, the overall impact of the efforts made by Member States in any given area is greater.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Changing focus - from accessible to both open and useful</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>FACT: Over 90% of all material in Europeana Collections has been provided by cultural heritage institutions from EU Member States (as of August 2018 - see report p.40).&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Member States apply national coordination to create a bridge between CHIs and Europeana. They encourage cultural heritage institutions, as well as other publishers and rights holders, to make digitised material accessible through Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s clear from the report - and it’s visible from the count on the home page of Europeana Collections - that the work to provide material to Europeana is going well. Quantitative targets have been met, and so focus is now turning to quality over quantity. That’s great news and mirrors ongoing work from within the Europeana Foundation and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum to support institutions to provide high-quality open content and metadata through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FACT: 15% of content from EU Member States is in the ‘high-quality’ bracket (referring to content tiers 3 and 4 of the&nbsp; Europeana Publishing Framework - see report p.39). Spain and Sweden have the most high-quality items in Europeana, followed by the Netherlands, the UK and Germany (see report p.48).&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Member States’ contribution to the Europeana 280 campaign is reported as a good example of coordinated efforts to bring high-quality content into Europeana. Together, the Member States contributed more than <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?per_page=96&amp;q=Europeana+280&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;view=grid\">300 high-quality masterpieces</a> to Europeana Collections, the majority of which are now available for anyone to use for education, research or enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FACT: Top contributing countries as of August 2018 are The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, France and the UK. Among non-member countries, Norway is the biggest contributor to Europeana (see report p.41).&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report suggests that the emphasis on quality should also become part of the conditions for funding digitisation projects. So, if your institution is looking for funding, be sure to consider the quality of the data you want to produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FACT: Approximately one-third of the Member States report making public funding for digitisation projects conditional on linking to Europeana (see report p.45).</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What will Member States do next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The priorities set by the Member States have an effect on what work is supported at an institutional level. You can help to shape this for the future. Over the next few months, the European Commission will be consulting on an update to the policy recommendations that direct the Member States’ work. Look out for more details about the consultation and how you and your organisation can contribute later this month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Developing and supporting aggregation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana ecosystem builds on a network of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">national, thematic and domain aggregators</a>. Their primary aim is to support cultural institutions and provide access to authentic, trustworthy and robust data and content. Once available, that material can then be found and used by the general public, education, research and the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Member States are developing the use of such aggregators in order to better support institutions in their countries. The aggregators’ services differ but for&nbsp;the report include ‘digitisation and technical expertise, copyright and legal expertise, online access, translations, workshops and helpdesk availability’ (see report p.50).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FACT:&nbsp; Nearly three-quarters of Member States (20) have national aggregators for Europeana (see report p.49).</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Support for aggregators comes from both Member States and the Europeana initiative, via the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF). The size and scope of aggregators vary hugely and their needs cannot be met by a one-size-fits-all approach. Since the end of the period reported on, the EAF has set up an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/breathing-new-life-into-the-europeana-aggregators-forum\">Aggregator Accreditation Scheme</a> to acknowledge and recognise the role of the aggregator and to provide the benefit of peer-to-peer support through the EAF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Europe-wide standards for metadata and content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To make sure that cultural heritage institutions in the Member States provide metadata and content that works across borders, across languages and across systems, that material needs to adhere to universal standards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Europeana and the Member States support the use of a range of standards for rich and useful metadata and content. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier\">Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)</a> that link material back to its source no matter where you find it, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/linked-open-data-faq\">Linked Open Data</a> practices that link material to other relevant material, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/iiif-datasets-in-europeana-a-scholar-s-delight\">IIIF</a>, an interoperability standard for digital images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>FACT: 19 Member States use Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) to make sure their digitised content always links back to the source (see report p.54).&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana provides a widely adopted metadata standard - the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> - and a quality standard - the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework (EPF)</a>. Europeana is also part of the collaboration behind <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/en/\">rightsstatements.org</a> and the development of&nbsp;12 standardised rights statements for online cultural heritage. Together, these standards aim to ensure that all metadata and content provided to Europeana works effectively. That is, it serves the needs of both the providing institution and the target audiences, no matter who they are, what language they use or what they want to do with the material. The report shows that uptake of such standards is good and increasing. As such, the Member States are beginning to include quality targets for aggregators along with their quantity targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>FACT: 13 Member States report implementing rights statements from rightsstatements.org and using the guidelines set out in the Europeana Publishing Framework (see report p. 54).</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Endorsement of the Europeana Publishing Framework and Europeana Data Model by the Member States goes hand-in-hand with the work to promote these standards by the Europeana Network Association, the EuropeanaTech community and related Task Forces. A number of Member States have translated the Europeana Publishing Framework and several translation projects are underway for Rightsstatements.org rights statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This emphasis on aggregation and standards for metadata and content from the Member States is in line with the Europeana Foundation’s strategic plan and annual business plans. This report shows that, while challenges remain, Europeana, and the EU Member States are working to a shared strategy, which means that every effort we make, whether as individuals, institutions or nations, is valuable and towards a common goal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What will Member States do next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The priorities set by the Member States have an effect on what work is supported at an institutional level. You can help to shape this for the future. Over the next few months, the European Commission will be consulting on an update to the policy recommendations that direct the Member States’ work. Look out for more details about the consultation and how you and your organisation can contribute later this month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>National Museum of Serbia</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located in Belgrade, the museum has had a tumultuous history. It remained closed for 15 years due to renovations and organisational changes. Since its&nbsp;grand reopening in summer 2018, the museum has joined forces with GIFT consortium members NextGame, a Belgrade-based company specialising in playful projects and digital advertising, to develop digital solutions to modernise the exhibition of its eclectic collection of local archaeological findings, natural history and fine art.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Creating <em>Your Stories</em></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The experience was created over a 6-month period, involving close&nbsp;collaboration between museum employees and NextGame. The first step of the process included a public call inviting visitors to come to the museum with objects that they considered meaningful. A total of 25 visitors brought a variety of items such as clothing, military mementos,&nbsp;children’s toys and much more. Each piece was carefully 3D-scanned and visitors shared their personal stories about why their specific item should be immortalised in&nbsp;the museum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Incorporating visitor content in the museum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the first stage, museum curators and NextGame spent months carefully matching the digitally scanned items to the physical artefacts on display in the museum. The idea behind <em>Your Stories</em> was to show the everyday, human part of history. While the artefacts in display cases may seem distant and belonging to an era which we can’t relate to, at the same time they tell the story of our ancestors who perhaps weren’t as different from us as we think. Creating a narrative connecting the past and the present was the most important part of the process. For example, an exhibit on children’s toys dating from early human history was matched with a cosy toy added to the collection by one of the visitors - the favourite possession of their own child. It illustrated how everything we now treat as cultural heritage has once belonged to someone and has been a part of their lives, just as everyday objects that are meaningful to us now may one day become history themselves to our grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using the ARTcodes app&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The experience is enabled through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-gift-project-using-artcodes-to-create-monuments-for-a-departed-future\">ARTcodes technology</a> introduced by my colleagues in previous articles about the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-gift-project-give-visitors-the-tools-to-engage-deeper\">GIFT project</a>. ARTcodes are an artistic and creative way of tagging digital content, which can then be explored via an app. Every scanned object has been assigned a custom-made artcode, which upon scanning via smartphone leads visitors to the digital 3D model of the personal object as well as the short story of the person who brought it in. The simplicity and aesthetic value of ARTcodes were a good match to the needs of the curators, since introducing them to museum spaces is a highly customisable process and doesn’t disrupt the experience of visitors who prefer not to use technology during their stay. It was an important consideration based on experiences within the GIFT project, which highlighted how vital it is to give the museum staff agency and control, as well as to include them closely in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ARTcodes application has been successfully launched and tested, and <em>Your Stories</em> remains an ongoing part of the museum’s permanent exhibition. The results are in line with the strategic goals of the museum: the development process as well as the experience itself has helped curators show the collection in a new light while allowing visitors a more meaningful interaction with the objects. As expressed by one of museum managers,&nbsp;'<em>Your Stories</em> provokes (the audience) to have their own opinion. We want to develop the audience to be active, not just passive visitors who receive our stories, but to motivate them to communicate, and to have their own attitude, impressions, emotions and way of thinking.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to know more, you can visit the museum to test it yourself or <a href=\"http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/tvojeprice/\">check out the website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To read more about how the GIFT project is giving museum visitors a chance to engage more deeply with collections through a variety of tools,&nbsp; check out the other articles in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=GIFT-project\">GIFT news series</a>.

We work in the field of digital strategy with the tourism and culture industries, to create strategies that promote and valorise travel destinations as well as museums and galleries. When we started the initiative, we were working primarily for the travel industry, to create something more participatory for travel destinations - it was during the rise of the blogger, especially travel bloggers. So the idea was, why don’t we apply the same concept to museums and cultural heritage?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We realised that a lot of people weren’t going to museums because they thought they were boring - people felt disconnected. Today tons of museums are using social media, but back in 2012, nobody was. People preferred to shop or go to the mall. When we first came up with that insight, the museum professionals said, ‘No! People don’t choose to go to a mall instead of going to a museum.' And we said, ‘Yes... they do.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Italian museums at that moment had no Wi-Fi, no interaction, just a slip of paper with the name of the painting and ‘oil on canvas, 1882’. It was just not engaging at all. We had to change the way that museums were communicating about themselves. Obviously we wanted to bring in digital resources, but we also asked people, ‘What do you want to do in museums? How can we help people have fun and be more engaged in museums?’ After lots of brainstorming, it hit us: ‘We need to invade museums like Attila and destroy everything!’ So we became <em>Invasioni Digitali</em> - which literally means digital invasion. Obviously we didn’t want to really destroy museums! We wanted to destroy the old approach of how they were communicating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We thought of it as a digital accelerator for museums - we wanted to make the museum experience more participatory and more fun. We looked at the experiences made by the Getty for example, who share high-res images of pieces from the museum and invite people to play with the artworks - to change them, to give them a new life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At first we called our network of friends, followers and bloggers to come with us, and we created an event. The first one was held in April 2013 - it lasted one week. We asked people during that week to choose any kind of cultural site - and invade it, and tell the story of that place in a more personal way. The very first year, we had 225 invasions in one week! Probably we were just in the right place at the right time - people really wanted to discover the cultural heritage of the country. They were just waiting for something… Since then we’ve run six campaigns - so one every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvWCqCTA5mN/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s the power of a digital invasion for a cultural heritage institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital invasion is going into the museum and sharing a storytelling experience - taking pictures and videos that create a story and sharing our individual emotions and feelings about the museum. For example, if that’s a museum in my city that I know very well - I can’t tell the whole history of the museum, but I can tell people <em>my</em> story with the museum. The whole story gets told via social media - Instagram Stories, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat - everything. Before and after the invasion, we post information on blogs to prepare people and spread the word about the initiative. We want to create the highest level of participation across different groups: young people, teenagers, adults and seniors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first year many museums were like, ‘No, no… I don’t like the word “invasion”, I don’t want you to invade us… to destroy anything!’&nbsp; And a lot of museums thought that people were just going to go to the museums to take selfies... Others thought, ‘We’ve worked like this for ages, why do we have to change now?’ But after a little while, even very big museums invited us to organise digital invasions. They understood they should do something different to engage more people. For example we’ve collaborated with Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, the Reggia di Caserta and the Venaria Reale in Turin just to name a few. After the first year, we also went outside the Italian borders - we’ve had invasions in Germany, France, Australia, America and Brazil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There’s always a ‘Chief Invader’ or supervisor who coordinates and leads the invasion. Sometimes it’s the museum that organises the digital invasion, or sometimes it’s someone from outside - in that case we contact the museum and ask them if they agree to be ‘invaded’. Then together with us, the Chief Invader creates a theme for the invasion. For example, the Madre Museum in Naples created the <a href=\"https://archivio.invasionidigitali.it/invasione/yellowinvasion-invasione-al-museo-madre-napoli/\">‘Yellow Invasion’</a>: the theme was to spot all the masterpieces in the museum related to the colour yellow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What would be your top tip(s) for anyone thinking of using this kind of digital storytelling approach?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First of all, they have to understand that we are moving towards a model in which knowledge is no longer transmitted in one direction - it’s co-created. As Jim Richardson said…. we’re not talking about an audience, we’re talking about participants. This is the starting point. So to create a digital invasion, cultural sites have to keep in mind that they have to do something <em>for</em> people, <em>with</em> them. Not just promote their location. The main goal is to engage people, so they have to create something that’s different from the things that they do every day. A particular tour that has a story, like a <em>fil rouge</em> that people can interact with and feel a part of. So not just ‘this is the statue of blah, blah, blah…’ it’s not that kind of tour. And it’s different for every museum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example at the Museum of Cinema in Turin, we had a nighttime invasion - an invasion taking place at night with the staff dressed up as characters from the movies, sharing information about the museum as if they were that character. The most successful ones are when the museums are completely involved. Invasions can be anything - museums just have to think about things that they don’t do every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Since people are posting on all different platforms, how does all the output of an invasion connect since it doesn’t ‘live’ in one central place?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We ask people to have or activate at least one social profile to be able to post all the pictures and videos. We use our general hashtag - <a href=\"https://www.invasionidigitali.it/en/social-wall/\">#InvasioniDigitali</a> - and then we ask the Chief Invader to choose a particular hashtag for the invasion, for example the one I mentioned - the <a href=\"https://www.napolike.it/invasione-digitale-al-museo-madre-di-napoli-con-visita-gratuita\">#YellowInvasion</a>. Every time the invaders post, the stream grows with all the pictures and videos, and you can follow the invasion by following the hashtag. The museum also uses its social profiles to share and amplify the content that people post online in real time, and also later after the invasion. The most important thing is that the invasion isn’t just an event that happens at a certain date and time and then stops. It should be the starting point of something different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

I don’t have favourites, but there’s a story that I like a lot - there’s a guy in Liguria, a very small village in the northwest of Italy. He runs an association for a small church there. He organised an invasion during the first year and he sent me an email thanking Invasioni Digitali because the invasion was one of the most participated events in the history of the church&nbsp; - about 70 people. The village is very small and it was the first time that all the parking places in town were completely full! He told me that they’re going to repeat it every summer because they saw that people really enjoyed it, and the association learnt how they needed to work differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve also had children’s invasions - but since obviously children don’t usually have smartphones, we gave them disposable cameras and they went through the museum telling the story of the museum from a child’s point of view. So we have all the pictures from ‘baby height’, all the feet of the statues… It was really fun. And the last one from an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0L-OPKolaJ/\">invasion at the Forte San Giovanni</a> - like a military tower base in Liguria - there were a lot of children and they invaded the fort as soldiers with (obviously) fake swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0L-OPKolaJ/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you become involved with the GIFT project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seven years ago, Anders Sundnes Løvlie, now Principal Investigator of the GIFT project, and I participated in the making of Random Friends, a hybrid street game, that was played simultaneously in Trondheim, Norway, and Belgrade, Serbia. It was a game about two countries in Northern and Southern Europe that do not belong to the European Union. So the first contact between Anders and me was as game designers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Random Friends was a so-called ‘critical game’ that explored our attitudes and understanding of the European Union from an external perspective. Several years later, Anders invited me to join the GIFT consortium and here we are – participating together in the EU H2020 project GIFT, this time from a different perspective. I find this is quite a symbolic circle – where the EU acts either as a conceptual or administrative frame for our research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell me a little about ‘appropriation’ and how it has impacted your work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Readers of the other articles <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=GIFT-project\">in this series</a> will be familiar with how the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-gift-project-museums-of-the-future-tap-into-the-gift-app\">GIFT app</a> is based on the creative use of gifting, i.e., giving... However, we’ve also been working on projects based on taking. By ‘taking’ I mean – appropriation, as a method of personalisation and transformation of artworks.&nbsp; What do we take with us from a museum visit? Is a museum object confined to a museum or exhibition context forever, or can it be decontextualised and made ‘mine’ by personalising it? Can it be ‘mine’ in a much deeper and more profound sense than the concept of material and legal ownership? When considering appropriation we tend to raise many questions... and so are trying to provide some answers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike well-known appropriation models where artists re-use existing objects and materials to create new artwork, we have focused on appropriation carried out by visitors. We have tested different personalisation methods and techniques to make a museum visit a strong emotional experience, where museum objects are perceived as something that belongs to our personal and intimate emotional space. In this sense appropriation is not understood as an artistic method or cultural policy but as an approach that connects our emotions and experiences with the museum exhibition. We developed a special museum web application called Sensitive Pictures to enable visitors to establish such connections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sensitive Pictures creates an intimate emotional museum experience by leading visitors on a journey through their personal memories, hopes and thoughts.&nbsp; Using the app, visitors choose which emotions they would like to explore… (e.g. love, passion, nostalgia, etc.). Each emotion is connected to a different museum object and evoked by specially-designed audio content to connect museum stories with personal memories. During the experience, visitors think about their feelings and try to understand and describe them. As a result, each visitor takes their own private path through a museum collection based on their emotions, perceiving museum objects as milestones in the personal journey. Sensitive Pictures highlights the uniqueness of our encounters with art, which are subject to our own experiences, knowledge and emotions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also brought an educational aspect to Sensitive Pictures by providing experts’ insights about every museum object. This part of the app is also designed to fit into the emotional context of the whole experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where&nbsp;can we experience Sensitive Pictures for ourselves?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are currently testing Sensitive Pictures in the <a href=\"https://munchmuseet.no/en/\">Munch Museum, Oslo</a>. The Munch Museum is a perfect lab environment for this kind of research – dedicated to the oeuvre of a man who thought that his paintings were the equivalent of diary pages, making them extremely personal and thus universal. Additionally, the&nbsp;museum was&nbsp;open to&nbsp;initiatives, research and learning about new methods of visitors’ engagement - which has been very important in the development of this experiment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">Nottingham University’s Mixed Reality Lab has developed a special emotion-detection prototype that uses a camera to analyse facial expressions and link them with corresponding emotions. As a final part of the Sensitive Pictures experience, visitors are invited to have a conversation with an avatar of Edvard Munch. First test results show that many visitors perceive this part of the experience as the most exciting - being faced with Edvard Munch who, just as any of us would during our everyday conversations and meetings, tries to understand what the person he is talking to is feeling during the conversation. Each visitor receives a small personal gift after the experience based on their unique emotional feedback. Participants can then judge for themselves whether a computer is able to understand human emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkMZZeJTdeY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the next steps for this project and are there any ways people working in museums can get involved?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each component of the Sensitive Pictures project could be adapted to other museums and cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp; We have also developed a universal storytelling application that can be used for simple creation of stories in any museum. So with several strong storytelling tools to choose from, we welcome and invite museum professionals to get involved and discover how to apply them in their own institutions. We’re happy to share our experience and knowledge with people who work in museums as well as with culture lovers who are curious and willing to participate in a unique emotional&nbsp; adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of the day, our collaboration with museums, Mixed Reality Lab, ITU and other partners is probably the most important aspect of our work. Thanks to Munch Museum and its staff, we learnt a lot about their work, challenges and needs, and how we can collaborate to improve visitors’ experiences. As previously demonstrated by the ARTcodes projects for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-gift-project-introducing-personal-objects-to-museum-space-through-your-stories\">National Museum of Serbia</a>, we create custom-made experiences based on visitors’ emotions and stories, to transform the museum experience into a two-way street we can travel together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You’ve also taken some of the appropriation theory and tested it in an environment away from the museum. Can you describe this process?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In December 2018, we contacted the National Museum of Serbia and one of the biggest cinema halls in Belgrade – Kombank Dvorana. Together we created a special cinema experience based on our findings from tests with the Munch Museum and the Museum of Yugoslavia. We made four 60-second movies called #OneMinuteMuseum – a unique cinema advertising format shown on screen before the feature film, each dedicated to one piece from the collection of the National Museum of Serbia to promote national art heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each movie aimed to take viewers on a completely personal journey through their hopes and fears, by using stories about museum objects as movie trailers that were played at the end of the cinema advertising block before the main movie. They were a complete surprise for the first-time viewers. Played in six halls of a large cinema complex, they were seen by almost 50,000 visitors during the first few months.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you see this kind of technology connecting various art forms in the future?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The National Museum had a vision and a modern strategic approach to engage and expand their audience through new and innovative channels. And Kombank Dvorana was eager to join forces with the National Museum to promote culture. Therefore it was a win-win situation. It’s very important to create partnerships that open new communication channels, so it’s not just about technology - it’s about mutual understanding and partnership. Technology comes after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The #OneMinuteMuseum project is a highly evocative and persuasive guided fantasy that takes viewers on a journey through their imagination. With an educational part as well, it strikes a good balance between emotion and information. Although we’ve really just begun working with this format, it’s obvious that the possibilities are literally endless. By connecting museums and cinemas (and television and other media), and making strong emotional, poetic experiences inspired by museum objects, we’re able to produce a very special kind of content with great media potential. That potential is still to be explored and developed, which is an extremely exciting opportunity for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>GIFT @ Europeana 2019</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bogdan will be joining other members of the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/\">GIFT project</a> at Europeana 2019 and you can hear all about the project so far, the research underpinning it and test some of the tools yourself at GIFT @ Europeana 2019. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2019-connect-communities-tickets-61030544000\">Book your ticket</a> and select GIFT @ Europeana 2019 to guarantee your seat.</p>\r\n"

The technology is open source, therefore free to use and adapt to your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/v65uslxj7uhcjda/GIFT%20conference%20draft%20programme%20v3.pdf?dl=0\">View the programme for GIFT @ 2019</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Historiana workshop moderated by Steven Stegers - Executive Director - EUROCLIO</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Explore different ways cultural heritage institutions and museum educators can use digitised sources in history education. This <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-can-we-help-history-teachers-teach-from-multiple-perspectives-it-starts-with-sources\">EUROCLIO</a> workshop will present peer-reviewed eLearning Activities developed by history educators using Europeana sources, and explain both the reasoning and research theory underpinning them. There will be a focus on how you can easily adapt these to create your own eLearning Activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Could your institution integrate its collections into educational activities? Would you be willing to collaborate with others on this? We'll close the session with a brainstorm on these questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3D Task Force seminar moderated by Kate Fernie - Director - 2Culture Associates&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3D digitisation of cultural heritage has become more common in recent years and organisations are increasingly looking for ways of using 3D data, and for ways of integrating with other file types in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This one-day workshop will bring together a panel from members of the 3D Content in Europeana Task Force to discuss recent work and to talk about standards, formats and platforms that support 3D data. This workshop will provide an opportunity to share results, exchange knowledge about state-of-the-art opportunities for collaboration and discuss the next steps to use 3D more effectively with digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>IIIF workshop moderated by Glen Robson - IIIF Technical Coordinator</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and EuropeanaTech will hold an outreach event for a wide range of participants and interested parties, including digital image repository managers, content curators, software developers, scholars, and administrators at libraries, museums, cultural heritage institutions, software firms, and other organisations working with digital images and audio/visual materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Attendees will learn about the purpose and benefits of IIIF for web-based image delivery, including demonstrations of the optimised functionality that IIIF provides. A specific afternoon session in collaboration with the 3D Content in Europeana Task Force will look at how IIIF and Europeana can move forward with regards to presenting 3D content online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ncktxl9c4pw7qh4/IIIF%20Agenda.pdf?dl=0\">View the programme for the IIIF workshop</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>European Open Science Cloud workshop moderated by Sara Di Giorgio - Project Manager at the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This workshop will introduce the <a href=\"https://www.eosc-portal.eu/\">European Open Science Cloud</a> (EOSC), discuss the opportunities its creation offers the cultural heritage sector and provide an overview of the infrastructures behind its development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It will address the challenges and opportunities that the establishment of EOSC is posing to cultural heritage institutions.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In July, I was invited to do a takeover of the @OpenGLAM Twitter Account. That means that I was allowed to host that account and to send my tweets into the world speaking as @OpenGLAM (usually I’m @PSoemers).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘OpenGLAM’ stands for “Opening up Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums”. Their Twitter ‘bio’&nbsp; states that they are a ‘Global network helping Galleries, Libraries, Archives &amp; Museums open their data &amp; content. Run by @okfn @creativecommons @wikimedia’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The painting shown above comes from the collection of Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK) in Copenhagen. You can find it in Europeana Collections because SMK released the descriptive keywords (‘metadata’) in an appropriate format AND under the open licence, CC0, which means that there is no copyright on them. On top of that, the museum delivered the image in good quality ➜ OpenGLAM at its best!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the 10 days of my #openglamPS takeover, I wanted to give people something helpful, inspirational&nbsp; or simply fun, for their professional or their daily lives. In order to enable quick and permanent access to all tweets during my takeover I used the hashtag #openglamPS. I learned this ‘trick’ from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nealstimler/status/1101494870018060290\">Neal Stimler</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did I tweet about?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I wanted my Twitter takeover to tell the story of the importance of open cultural heritage - what I love about it and why I think it’s important. Here are some of the things I tweeted about.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I posted artworks with cows</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I posted my personal pictures from exhibition ‘<a href=\"https://www.rmo.nl/en/exhibitions/temporary-exhibitions/medieval-gardens/\">Medieval Gardens</a>’ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RM_Oudheden\">@RM_Oudheden</a> and linked to related images in #OpenGLAM Collections, in this way expanding the exhibition in the digital world</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I made statements about #OpenGLAM as an attitude and a way of life</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I recalled the moral obligations and potential societal impact GLAMs are having</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I presented examples of GLAMs partnering with creative industries</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I presented examples of GLAMs facilitating use and reuse of online collections</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I investigated whether ‘ordinary people’ are interested in open collections and artworks online – yes, they are!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I presented examples of personal initiatives of ‘ordinary people’ creating great things on the web</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I paid attention to @Europeanaeu as a source, facilitator and online exhibitor</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I paid attention to @Wikimedia and @CreativeCommons, but not as much as I wanted ☹</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">I didn’t mention things like hackathons using #OpenGLAM materials ➜ unforgivable! ☹☹</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 70-page <a href=\"https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ReportonCulturalHeritageDigitisationOnlineAccessibilityandDigitalPreservation.pdf\">Cultural Heritage: Digitisation, Online Accessibility and Digital Preservation</a> report looks at progress made by the 28 EU Member States between 2015 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The recommendation that the report measures progress against was developed in 2011, and this autumn, the European Commission is launching a consultation to update it. The recommendation helps ministries of culture in each of the EU Member States to set the priorities and directions, and support the work done by cultural heritage institutions in their countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European collaboration is vital to safeguarding our cultural heritage. By working towards the same Europe-wide recommendation for digital culture, the overall impact of the efforts made by Member States in any given area is greater.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the European Commission doing?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Commission is evaluating one of its main policy instruments on digitisation, online access and digital preservation of cultural heritage material. The aim is to gather stakeholders’ views - that’s you - on whether the policy recommendation that’s been in existence since 2011 needs updating to better reflect public needs and increase the potential of Europe’s cultural heritage for the benefit of Europeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why are the recommendations being evaluated?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The publicly-available <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-3806289_en\">two-page roadmap</a> for this evaluation says that, ‘technology and the process of digitisation of cultural heritage have made major leaps since 2011, while the cultural heritage sector has also evolved.’ And that the current recommendation is being evaluated with a view to revise it ‘based on lessons learned from the evaluation and relevant new technologies/technological trends’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The roadmap cites the recent fire at Notre-Dame de Paris as highlighting the urgent need to ‘make the most of digital technologies to record, document and preserve Europe’s cultural heritage and foster their accessibility by European citizens.’ It cites 3D, linked data, big data and artificial intelligence as areas of technological interest, as well as a potential focus on updating the lifecycle of digitisation, the implications of the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector and spillovers between culture and other sectors such as tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A public consultation and related research</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In October/November, a 12-week public consultation will begin. As an online survey, it will be available in all EU languages and to all citizens via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en\">Commission website</a>, and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digitisation-digital-preservation\">dedicated page on digital culture policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There will also be surveys and interviews with Member States as well as national, small and medium-sized cultural heritage institutions and workshops with cultural umbrella organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The evaluation will also take into account the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-commission-report-cultural-heritage-digitisation-online-accessibility-and-digital\">recent report on progress against the current recommendation</a>, last year’s <a href=\"https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/58538a59-b4aa-11e8-99ee-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Evaluation of Europeana</a>, recent <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/charting-trends-in-digitisation-of-heritage-collections-read-the-enumerate-survey-results\">ENUMERATE reports</a> and the minutes of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\">the Commission Expert Group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final report based on all evidence gathered will be made available online in June 2020 with the new recommendation likely to be adopted by the Commission in autumn 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-5d6a1701-7fff-7874-cb88-5a4be6d908c3\">Your views are important</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission wants to hear your views. This is your opportunity to respond and to make sure that the voice of the cultural heritage sector is heard. Keep an eye on Europeana Pro News in October for news of the start of the public consultation. In the meantime, you might like to take a look at the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-3806289_en\">roadmap</a> and start to consider your response both as an individual and an organisation.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This summer, throughout Europe, millions of people will attend electronic music festivals. In the Netherlands alone, every weekend there are dozens of options spanning just as many genres and styles. Since it migrated from Chicago and Detroit to Europe, electronic music has continued to grow, dominating Europe’s musical landscape and defining its future musical heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing the potential of this dynamic creative community as a potential collaborator for cultural heritage institutes, the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/re-vive\">RE:VIVE</a> initiative has spent the last three years working to grow fruitful new partnerships. These partnerships explore new ways of reusing <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />cultural heritage material, storytelling and sharing it with young audiences. In our experience, one of the best ways to do this is to simply release new records.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Music as a storytelling medium</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Music is the perfect medium for storytelling due to the various means through which it can be consumed either actively or passively. It can be in the forefront or background, accessed in numerous ways and discovered for years&nbsp;to come.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This summer, RE:VIVE, in collaboration with three of electronic music’s most reputable record labels — Dekmantel, MORD, and Subtext Recordings — released three very different records that showcase just how versatile and inspiring cultural heritage can be for a wide array of artists and audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3116657970/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">V/A - Scores by Jordan GCZ, upsammy, Suzanne Kraft, Parrish Smith</iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><em>V/A - SCORES</em>&nbsp;is RE:VIVE’s first collaborative release with Dekmantel. It features four original scores for archival films that were shown in 2018 during their festival at the Eye Filmmuseum. The four films, <em>Lichtspiel Opus Licht: II, III IV</em> by Walter Ruttmann, <em>Uit het rijk der kristallen</em> by J.C. Mol, Sosoon by George Singer and <em>Prelude28</em> by Vladimir Murtin were provided by Sound and Vision and Eye Filmmuseum. The invited artists, Parrish Smith, upsammy, Jordan gcz, and Suzanne Kraft all channeled their specific sounds and paired masterfully with these beautiful films, giving the lost gems a second life and reappearance on the big screen. Through the record and film scores, we get to tell the story of these films again, several of which were widely unknown. The LP is now available on vinyl, as well as via download and on all streaming platforms. Or <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/dekmantel\">visit our website</a> to watch the movies set to their new music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=920008045/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">Sutarti by Joshua Sabin</iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><em>Joshua Sabin - Sutarti</em> is the second full-length record by Scottish composer Joshua Sabin on Subtext Recordings. The project was done in collaboration with the Lithuanian Archivists Association and the Lithuanian Music and Theater Archive, made possible by a grant from the Lithuanian Cultural Council. RE:VIVE invited composer Joshua Sabin to create a new record made out of and inspired by archival recordings of traditional Lithuanian vocal music, especially <em>sutartines</em>. Sabin and RE:VIVE visited Lithuania for a week in May 2018 to dive deeper into this topic and meet with researchers and performers. Sabin’s concluding work is a mystifying cinematic blend of the dynamic harmonies that define Lithuanian music and contemporary classical composition. It conveys and tells the story of Lithuania’s strong cultural asset, once again giving these recordings and tradition a new breath of fresh air and perspective, bringing them to audiences around the globe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can explore the entire collection used by Sabin <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=SOUND&amp;f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=LMTA%20(DIZI)&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\">on Europeana Collections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3572078892/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">Rotterdam by Various Artists</iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>V/A - Rotterdam</em> is a 3xLP compilation on Rotterdam techno label MORD featuring 14 tracks ranging from drone ambience to blistering techno. What makes this compilation special? Every track is composed solely out of archival field recordings of Rotterdam from the Sound and Vision archive. Each artist translated his or her vision of the city through these sounds, channeling the harbour city’s industrial sonic landscape of ship horns and heavy machinery, perfect for big Berghain rooms and sound systems. For those artists from Rotterdam, they took the opportunity to reconnect with their city — like Bas Mooy’s 'West Kruiskade'&nbsp;inspired by late-night walks home with his friends, or Charlton’s 'Tram 4 op de Bergweg'. Their own stories were translated through the sounds and memories of the past in a way that’s relatable for contemporary audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more field recordings from Sound and Vision you can <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=SOUND&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Netherlands+Institute+for+Sound+and+Vision\">explore them on Europeana</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These three records add more diversity and use-cases to RE:VIVE’s growing list of projects and collaborations. The eagerness and excitement of the artists and involved parties continues to be inspiring, reaffirming the notion that cultural heritage and electronic music are a perfect match to revisit and reuse the past. As more institutes open up their collections, the potential for new projects and experiments only continues to grow, allowing us to present the past as never heard before.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In January 2019, a small but enthusiastic partner consortium kicked off ‘<a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/\">WeAre#EuropeForCulture</a>’: a project funded by the European Commission as a continuation of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Off on a journey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project takes an innovative approach toward user-engagement, focussed on getting hard-to-reach target audiences involved with (digital) cultural heritage. At the heart of it is a series of co-creation sessions held <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/#\">in 10 European cities</a>, allowing for crowdsourced heritage to be mixed with institutional heritage and shown side-by-side in virtual pop-up exhibitions. The pan-European tour of WeAre#EuropeForCulture is now at its midway point, relying on diligent preparation of co-creation scenarios, tailor-made workshop solutions and state-of-the-art technology for every successful leg.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apart from lessons learnt and targets reached, the main thing we take away from this experience so far is the marvel of the co-creative process, the value of face-to-face, onsite contact and the enthusiasm of communities realising that personal stories and local culture are indeed ‘heritage’ in their own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A team with&nbsp;big aspirations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s very much a team effort. Next to the project members, a wide network of partners across Europe is involved to realise the events in important European cities. While project coordinator <a href=\"https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/\">KU Leuven</a> looks after workshop methodology development, storytelling and curation, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a> co-ordinates the collaboration with&nbsp;its network of&nbsp;institutional members for the organisation of co-creation sessions and exhibitions, and manages communication activities. Technical partner <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/\">Noterik</a> provides the support and tools needed to produce the crowdsourced content and virtual exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content is being created during workshops using <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/products/qandr\">QANDR</a> – a dynamic and interactive discussion tool. It is then shared via <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/products/mupop\">MuPop</a> – an application that allows you to use a TV screen as an exhibition showcase, enabling passersby to interact with it via their own smartphones. A local partner in each city gets to select the basic theme of the co-creation session, as well as which local user communities to engage with, the eligible photo collections and an exhibition format (a ‘deck of cards’ featuring up to seven narrative chapters, a ‘hotspot’ with one picture featuring multiple stories, or a ‘quiz’). The project team then provides a complete setup and follow-up toward the end result: an up-and-running exhibition, in which visual material is combined with audio clips carrying the narrative.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>On the road</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So far, workshops and exhibitions have taken place in <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/amsterdam/\">Amsterdam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/budapest/\">Budapest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/sofia/\">Sofia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/hameenlinna/\">Hameenlinna</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/krakow/\">Krakow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/pisa/\">Pisa</a>. Throughout the series, we’ve encountered a wide variety of communities – from university students and high-school classes to children with a hearing impairment, to senior citizens and former prisoners. They have collected and transformed a broad range of stories including 1989 in Budapest, the Cyrillic alphabet, life in prison, memories of the Arno river and leisurely outdoor activities. Both our team and our workshop attendees were amazed by the energy and opportunities generated by the co-creative process. The technological tools and personal contacts foster discussion and creativity, and allow for an almost immediate conversion from idea into visual, from visual into audio narrative, and from all that into ready-to-use exhibition. This experience demonstrates the potential and importance of storytelling in the field of cultural heritage. The key to a successful implementation is, in our view, a multi-layered and multi-focal concept, in which digital meets physical, history meets reality, curator meets user, and information meets emotion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Casus Pisa</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Emotion was an important driver in the selection of exhibition themes by our local partners. In each case, we aimed at appealing to the targeted communities by choosing topics to which they could easily and immediately relate. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/arno-compagno-di-vita-exhibition-in-pisa-28-june-2019/\">the Pisa exhibition</a>, created by Photoconsortium, the theme was the river Arno as a life companion to Pisa citizens over the centuries: from regattas to floods, to bathing and fishing, to the yearly celebration of local saint San Ranieri and the ‘Gioco del Ponte’ - a traditional game recalling ancient military simulations, played by participants dressed in 16th century Spanish costumes.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in recent decades the river has become severely polluted; today bathing, swimming and fishing aren’t recommended, but traditional festivities continue to be held along the river and its bridges. For the WeAre#EuropeForCulture effort, we wanted to involve senior citizens who have experienced the river in full, and create interaction with younger generations so as to let them exchange views and stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To that end, a crowdsourcing campaign geared toward senior Pisa citizens took place in April and May, to collect photographs, stories and objects about the Arno. This was conducted on a one-to-one basis, meeting each person at home for interviews and collection of memorabilia. Through these encounters and the materials received, we identified a series of recurring topics that formed the foundations of the exhibition chapters. Then a co-creation session on 31 May brought together the senior contributors with teenagers, to explore how the river was experienced in the past and how the current generation relates to local traditions. In addition, collaboration was established with local associations (the Rowing Society, the Photoclub, and the photo archive of a local press photographer), collectors of vintage photographs and local history buffs, who were also invited to the joint co-creation session. It was a happy and creative meeting. We shared a preliminary selection of the collected images and proposed the exhibition chapters. The feedback was overwhelming, because everybody wanted to share their thoughts and memories, each comment generating others. Some of the senior participants already knew each other, while others discovered distant kinships or common friends. And the youngsters were captivated by the sometimes bizarre and passionate stories from the time of their grandparents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The co-creation session allowed us to finalise the exhibition setup. Family photos were digitised and combined with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/photography?q=Pisa&amp;view=grid\">archival material available on Europeana Collections</a>. In the course of the selection process the material was reorganised into three features: an interactive exhibition; a showreel of heritage photographs; and a physical display of printed photographs and heritage objects.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">The audio narrative of the interactive exhibition required some more research. We wanted to maintain the engaging, familiar and vernacular atmosphere of the co-creation session, while incorporating more ‘formal’ content as well. We envisaged quotations from literature, history and the arts, co-existing with typical mottos and colloquial sayings, as well as cultural and artistic photos set next to informal pictures from family albums. The biggest challenge was to make the narrative meaningful, entertaining and short: less than one minute per chapter was the recommended duration in view of the MuPop requirements (and the average attention span of today’s users).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 28 June the exhibition was successfully launched. Originally planned to run until 21 July, the Museum of Graphics decided to extend it until the end of August following public acclaim. For anyone interested but unable to travel to Tuscany before the closing date, the photographs and Italian texts of ‘Arno, compagno di vita’ are published <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/arno-compagno-di-vita/\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andiamo!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Midway. That means a whole lot of memories and experiences taken on board, but still a lot to look forward to as well! Apart from four more similar events planned in the second part of this year (<a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/basel/\">Basel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/vilnius/\">Vilnius</a>, <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/girona/\">Girona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/nicosia/\">Nicosia</a>), a special project effort is being made in Amsterdam – the home base of Noterik. There we are continuously following the arc of the project, allowing for the project methodologies to be tested and proven before being implemented in each new location. This way, the ongoing development of the technology, the setup and the co-creative strategy can be observed in a controlled environment. <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/europeforculture/final-event/\">A final event will be organised in Brussels</a> in February 2020: a culmination and combination of stories and media, intended as a forum for sharing experiences, fostering replication and inspiring new initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the coming months, we look forward to joining students and seniors, migrant communities and emerging artists, GLAM pros and novice culture consumers to revel in stories about sports, rituals, family portraits, changing cityscapes and community spirit. Whatever awaits us, we can already say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating: co-creation works – in theory and in practice. For both storytelling and its intended audience, tools such as QANDR and MuPop provide new ways to connect to a more engaged, more widely shared heritage experience.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About Europeana Research</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Research Community has a membership of over 1,400 professionals and a mission to help its members to get a deeper insight into researchers’ needs and to meet them where they concern the use of digital cultural heritage. In line with Europeana’s support of cultural heritage institutions in their process of digital transformation, these grants have been designed to further encourage cross-sectoral collaboration and exchanges between cultural heritage and research institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the grants</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have allocated a total budget of 25,000 euro to assist in the planning, organisation and execution of events that bring together cultural heritage professionals and researchers with a twofold goal:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Address challenges and opportunities related to the reuse of cultural heritage data in research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Provide training opportunities to build up the digital capabilities of cultural heritage professionals involved in research projects.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The theme for organising these events is: <strong>Digital Cultural Heritage for Open Science</strong>. Possible topics include (but are not limited to): Linked Open (Usable) Data, Standardisation and Interoperability, and Copyright (Exceptions for Research and best practices).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposals can address the field of Cultural Heritage in general or focus on one of its specific domains (such as Galleries, Libraries, Archives, or Museums). They can also address the challenges and opportunities for specific academic disciplines that use digital cultural heritage as a source for research, (for example, Archaeology, History, Linguistics, History of Art and Architecture). The types of events that will be considered include conferences, workshops, seminar series, summer schools and training activities. To maximise impact, we are particularly looking for events with outcomes that deliver value to a wider audience for the long term, such as reports, whitepapers, recommendations, training tutorials or video interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The deadline for submissions is 31 October 2019 and the winning projects will be announced on Europeana Pro and social media on 20 November 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about the research grants, including eligibility, terms and conditions and how to submit your proposal, please visit our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research-events-grants-programme-2019-call-for-submissions?utm_source=Launch%20announcement&amp;utm_medium=Internal%20audience&amp;utm_campaign=Research%20Event%20Grants%202019\">call for submissions</a> page.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Since January 2015, Europeana has been one of the European Union’s Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI). The EU has several of them, others include safer internet for children, electronic health services, and business management. Every 18-24 months, the planning, partners and activities for Europeana DSI are renewed, ensuring that the service continues to do what the EU requires of it. We are currently on the fourth round - and so today we are working as Europeana DSI-4.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the European Commission published an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ten-years-europeana-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-digital-age\">evaluation of Europeana</a>, which outlined our achievements and some areas to focus on next. In this series, we will look at some of the Europeana DSI activities that the evaluation considered, giving you a greater understanding of the endeavours and challenges we’re working on right now.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Let’s start with the cultural heritage itself. It’s what Europeana is all about. And to us, that means the digital versions of the books, objects, paintings, music, films etc (our ‘content’) that are on display or stored away in museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual archives across Europe. But it’s not just that, it’s also the information that describes them (our &nbsp;‘metadata’). &nbsp;Improving the process for getting all of that into Europeana is one area that we are focusing on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How does culture find its way into Europeana Collections?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First the object has to be digitised by cultural heritage institutions - for example, by scanning the pages of a book, or photographing a statue from several angles. Then it has to be described - what is it, who created it, when, where, where is it now, who owns it now, is it in copyright? All of this (and more) needs to not only be decided, but recorded in a standardised way, no matter where it comes from in Europe, so that it can be displayed on Europeana Collections. We use the Europeana Data Model to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nOnce the digital content file is ready and the descriptive information is available, it can start making its way to Europeana. Europeana Collections displays cultural heritage material from around 3,700 different institutions &nbsp;- we can’t work with each of them individually. Instead, a network of aggregators collects the data from say, a specific country, or a type of institution like museums, or on a particular topic, like natural history, and from there, sends it on to us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once Europeana has the data, we do lots of checks on it, and enrich it with things like geo-location, or link it to other material or datasets through associated people, places or topic names.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past year alone, over 130 cultural heritage institutions from 34 countries received help and support from their aggregators on how to prepare collections for Europeana. This was work was reflected in more than 10 million collection items.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Our goal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s a long and often complex journey from museum vault to Europeana Collections. We want to make that journey easier and more rewarding for cultural heritage institutions and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What are the challenges that aggregators and cultural institutions face?<br />\r\nAll cultural heritage institutions are different. Some are big, some small. Some have plentiful resources for working on digital projects, many don’t. Some have staff with technical skill and enthusiasm, some don’t.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd the differences aren’t just at organisation level. Each of the EU Member States, although all tasked with contributing to Europeana through aggregators, have different levels of interest, resource and areas of focus.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere are tens of millions of items in Europeana Collections now. But not all of them are as useful or as easy to find as others. Why? Because the information used to describe them is incomplete or inaccurate, or because the quality of the photograph or file is not great. We are encouraging cultural heritage institutions to produce high-quality digital content and high-quality accompanying information.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd so our role is to help aggregators to support the cultural heritage institutions within their networks to contribute their collections as efficiently as possible, and to do so in a way that makes their collections as accessible and useful as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What we’re doing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, how do we do that in practice?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">We think working together across borders has great benefits so we have set up a forum for our aggregators to come together, to work with us and to help each other. This collective experience and expertise helps improve support to cultural institutions across Europe.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">We have also set up an accreditation scheme for aggregators to help them demonstrate their skills and knowledge, and that in turn can help them to better work with and support their contributing institutions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">We have recently developed our own bespoke system for managing new and updated material. This system, Metis, is now used by the team at Europeana headquarters, and with its automated procedures, is already reducing the time it takes for a collection to be processed and published. This means that updates to collections are available much sooner than they were before.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">To show how different quality levels for content and metadata can affect people’s ability to find and use collection items, we have a quality standard - the Europeana Publishing Framework. With the support of aggregators, we encourage providers to refer to this Framework to help move their collections up the quality levels.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over time, these initiatives will mean it’s easier to browse or to search for interesting and useful content that people can use in personal or professional projects. And that helps the contributing institution reach a much broader audience, and supports them in achieving their outreach goals of engaging the public with their valued collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re interested in the technical side of Europeana’s material, you can find out more about the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, and our network of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">aggregators</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’d like to contribute collections from your institution, please go to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services\">data provider</a> section of Europeana Pro, where you’ll find all the information you need to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The integration of digital cultural heritage in the classroom is increasingly important as the 21st century brings further opportunities for digital teaching and learning. While the national curriculum can differ from country to country within the European Union, the demand to understand our common European history, cultural heritage and challenges for the future stays all-encompassing. Digital cultural heritage can be used not only to educate about Arts, History or Literature, but it also gives an excellent basis for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). For example, students can study original drawings of Leonardo da Vinci to understand the development of engineering techniques. Cultural heritage helps to enhance students’ soft skills and supports them throughout their learning process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To integrate cultural heritage into the classroom, the Europeana Foundation (EF) has been working with European Schoolnet (EUN) for the last five years on creating Learning Scenarios (a teacher’s detailed description of the learning unit that guides class learning), testing them and training teachers on how to integrate them in their teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2018-2019 academic year, over 2,118 teachers from 45 countries, teaching mainly in primary and secondary schools, have been following trainings and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). They also have been involved in creating Learning Scenarios and using them in classes, impacting more than 38,000 students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachers participating in the project are organised in two groups (Ambassadors and User Group), they meet at face to face trainings in Brussels, prepare webinars, videos in different languages, create online training materials and regularly share experiences on the Teaching with Europeana blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2019–2020 academic year, the community is expected to grow by 1,000 teachers and will provide them with additional training opportunities. The Europeana in your classroom: building 21st century competences with digital cultural heritage MOOC will be offered in five languages with French and Italian added to the initial English, Spanish and Portuguese courses, bringing Europeana to even more pupils. More ready-to-use learning resources will be available to interested teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the full publication below.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'It’s time to prioritise digital culture and Europeana - take the European Union’s survey on the new Digital Europe Programme today'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Digital Europe Programme is a new funding programme from the European Union with a planned overall budget of €9.2 billion, which will shape and support the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economy. Europeana will be co-financed by this programme from 2022.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The European Union is now consulting on what the priorities will be for the first two years of the Digital Europe Programme. While Europeana is mentioned in the proposed priorities, sufficient support for us and for digital culture is not guaranteed - the programme covers a wide range of issues, activities and projects, and we all know that culture is often one of the first areas to get squeezed out. Vocal support for our work and our sector will give us the best chances of being allocated sufficient funding. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=61102\">proposal document</a>\_(p. 5) says as much, putting important store on this stakeholder consultation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your support is critical. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DEP_targeted_consultation\">Take the online survey</a> now and show the EU that support and ambition for digital cultural heritage is vital.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Responding to the survey</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The important question in the survey is in the ‘Areas and sectors for high impact deployments’ section and reads, ‘How important do you consider EU support for the digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions?’ We invite you to respond with ‘Very important’.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also have the opportunity to elaborate on the ‘actions you are most interested in’ within the ‘Synergies and implementation’ section. At Europeana, we believe that high quality, open culture coupled with cutting-edge tech is transformative and will lead to both social and economic innovations. Here, your survey response could include evidence from your own organisation about the importance of - and the challenges related to - producing high-quality open material and using digital technologies for culture.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This consultation is an opportunity for you to make sure the Commission hears the voice of the cultural heritage sector, so that our activities can be geared to supporting you. How does being part of Europeana benefit your organisation and your audiences? What support does the cultural heritage sector need from Europeana to support its digital transformation? What technologies do you think are important for bringing cultural heritage to life for today’s audiences?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the Digital Europe Programme?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Europe Programme is focused on ‘building the strategic digital capacities of the EU and on facilitating the wide deployment of digital technologies, to be used by Europe's citizens and businesses.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The programme will boost investments in supercomputing, artiﬁcial intelligence, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills, and ensuring a wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society. Digital cultural heritage and Europeana are part of these technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=61102\">Draft Orientations for the preparation of the work programme(s) 2021-2022</a> (p.26) include two priority actions related directly to Europeana. One concerns the existing Europeana platform and activities, the other concerns supporting digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions, which is at the heart of all Europeana does.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritise culture!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Change doesn’t just happen. It requires individuals, organisations, countries, and indeed the European Commission to share the same priorities. To allocate resources. To be committed. By contributing to this consultation, you can provide evidence to the European Commission that a commitment to digital culture is important, indeed vital, to the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about the\_<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/have-your-say-future-investment-europes-digital-economy\">consultation</a> and take the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DEP_targeted_consultation\">online survey</a><b>\_</b>now. The consultation will close on 25 October.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please also take a moment to share this call to action on social media. To make it easy, here’s a tweet to copy/paste:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I believe EU support for the digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions is vital for the #FutureOfEurope. Do you? Respond to the Digital Europe Programme consultation by 25 October to have your say:<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2nFYFUu\"> bit.ly/2nFYFUu</a> #allezculture</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A World War One digital ecosystem</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The commemoration of the centenary of the First World War has produced an abundance of digital outputs for the period from 1914-1918. This has generated a wealth of new digital resources for WWI research, including projects carried out by universities, libraries, museums, archives, and community groups – adding to a long-standing yet dynamic ecosystem of endeavours attempting to collect, expose, curate, educate and communicate the First World War in the digital domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, for example, with its Collection Days model, grew out of the <a href=\"https://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa\">Oxford Great War Archive</a> and has itself spearheaded a number of <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/about/collection-days-map/\">events such as transcribathons,</a> aimed at the collection of community-generated content, and culminating in a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-14-18-centenary-tour\">Centenary Tour</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using community-generated digital content for research&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Can community-generated digital content be reused meaningfully so as to produce new interpretations in the digital domain? I have been exploring this question. As a representative of ATHENA R.C, I have been part of the Europeana Research initiative since it started and currently contribute to its outreach activities. I am also working on an AHRC-funded project, <em><a href=\"http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/\">Living Legacies 1914-1918</a></em>, as part of a research team at the University of Glasgow. Professor Lorna Hughes, University of Glasgow, is co-Investigator on this project and also Chair of the Europeana Research Advisory Board. Together we are looking into a few questions emerging from the close study of this ecosystem and its digital outputs. Our extended research builds on existing studies and will gradually develop into a series of publications and conference presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This summer, Professor Hughes and I gave a presentation at the Digital Humanities 2019 Conference in Utrecht under the title <em>‘The Ties That Bind': The Creation, Use, And Sustainability Of Community Generated Histories</em>. This paper addressed the theme of community-generated digital content. More so than on any previous occasion, the centenary of the First World War extended a compelling invitation to the general public to contribute their memorabilia and, in a sense, to recreate their family stories in a digital dimension. Our aim in the paper was to explore the value and sustainability of digital content created in such a way. We started from research questions such as: Is this content significantly reused for digital storytelling? Will it be possible to preserve it adequately? Of course, we were also interested in the value and reusability of this kind of digital content in research, mainly in the field of History and Historiography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Are First World War digital collections reusable and sustainable?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While initiatives on the First World War in the digital domain represent a significant investment in digital collections, there has been little or no formal analysis of the impact of these digital outputs, how they are used, and how they can be developed and sustained over the long term. One emerging concern focusses on the long-term curation challenges and sustainability of community-generated digital content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Have you seen the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/draft-programme-europeana-2019\">draft programme</a> for Europeana 2019? We think it’s too good to miss and so\_we’ve compiled a handy list of five reasons to add Europeana 2019 to your November calendar. We highly recommend booking your ticket now before they sell out.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connect communities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all professional working in and around cultural heritage - your roles, your institutions, your passions and your skills are incredibly wide-ranging. Europeana 2019 focuses on the topics that connect you all. At this unique interdisciplinary event, 250 professionals with backgrounds and interests in tech, copyright, education, research, impact and communications will come together to explore where those communities meet and how each specialist group can support the others.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get up, get involved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year’s three-day conference at the National Library of Portugal, Lisbon, isn’t simply a few days listening to others talk. It’s a truly hands-on affair with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/draft-programme-europeana-2019\">workshops, discussions, panels, interaction and networking</a>. Attend. Contribute. Transform the world with culture.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No hierarchies here</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our prestigious keynote speakers are not off-limits — on the contrary, they’re approachable.

Trades and skills develop continually and with them, people’s daily lives, domestic and professional routines and attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you do, your work doesn’t stay within the office, the shop floor, the classroom, the construction site. Whenever we work, labour or volunteer, we’re part of a bigger picture. Your working life shapes your habits, your routines, your identity and your community. What happens in society and technology both shapes and is shaped by how and where we work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are invited to contribute to Europe at Work - read on to find out how you and your organisation can get involved, share your own stories and even set up your own events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What to look out for</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Collection days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From September to November 2019, Europeana along with museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe, will run a series of collection days which will record the stories of the people who have worked at industrial heritage sites across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People across Europe can join in by sharing a story about their working lives, wherever they worked, either online or at events to which they bring their stories along with material such as pictures, diaries, videos and letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first event is on 28-29 September 2019. It focuses on the Luso-Luxembourgeoises (the Portuguese community of Luxembourg) and will be held at Gare-Usines de Dudelange, Luxembourg.

        intro: "<p>Since January 2015, Europeana has been one of the European Union’s Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI). The EU has several of them, others include safer internet for children, electronic health services, and business management. The Europeana DSI showcases and provides online access to Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage through the Europeana Collections platform and supports cultural heritage institutions as they adapt to this digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the European Commission published an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ten-years-europeana-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-digital-age\">evaluation of Europeana</a>, which outlined our achievements and some areas to focus on next.\_In this series, we\_look at some of the Europeana DSI activities that the evaluation considered a priority, giving you a greater understanding of the endeavours and challenges we’re working on right now.</p>\r\n"

So we’re working hard to improve that.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How easy an item is to find or to use depends in part on the types and quality of the information we have about it. This post looks at how Europeana is supporting cultural heritage institutions to improve the digital files (content) and the accompanying information (metadata) that they provide for both new and existing collections.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are tens of millions of items on Europeana Collections but we know that not all of them are easy to find or easy to use and that can be frustrating. So we’re working hard to improve that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How easy an item is to find or to use depends in part on the types and quality of the information we have about it. This post looks at how Europeana is supporting cultural heritage institutions to improve the digital files (content) and the accompanying information (metadata) that they provide for both new and existing collections.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we saw in last week’s post, all cultural heritage institutions are different - they have different levels of resources and varying motivations and skills when it comes to digitising and documenting their collections. At Europeana, we dedicate a lot of our energy and resources to supporting institutions and aggregators so they understand both how to create better quality content and metadata, and the benefits of doing so. An important benefit being that once we have access to sufficient content and metadata, we can take steps to enrich it, making it more useful and easier to find.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our goal</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal is to have 70% of Europeana Collections reaching ‘good quality’ by next summer. We have a quality standard called the Europeana Publishing Framework&nbsp;which describes what ‘good quality’ means in terms of content and metadata, and shows how improving quality benefits both the providing institution and our audiences. By encouraging cultural heritage institutions to create better quality content and metadata, and by enriching the material further ourselves, we can develop more in-depth and engaging online experiences - meaning more people find what they’re looking for and have a better time doing it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Content and metadata come to Europeana from around 3,500 different cultural heritage institutions across Europe. Although most of it is set out in the same format, using the Europeana Data Model - a standard that we developed with cultural heritage professionals - it is not all consistent in its depth or quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quality means different things to different people. With our aggregator and provider partners, we have developed a quality standard - the Europeana Publishing Framework - that we use as a clear reference. For example, quality is improved by making sure that records include thumbnail images, that the content file is of a particular size/resolution, and that the metadata is unique, descriptive and complete, providing as much context as possible. Accuracy is, of course, vital too - and where things like links change over time and so become broken, we work with partners to put them right. Another important consideration is selecting the appropriate rights statements as they show people what they can do with an item. All of our items have clear rights statements and Europeana encourages the use of the more open and unrestrictive statements where possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we’re doing&nbsp;</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New innovations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">This year, we revised our quality standard, the Europeana Publishing Framework, to include standards for metadata in addition to the existing standards for content. We are always working on improving content and metadata not just in new collections but existing ones too and in the last year, the number of records that didn’t meet the standard was reduced by three million. We continue to work hard to support aggregators and institutions to refer to this Framework and to create better data.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">With better quality material and metadata, we’re also working to create better online experiences. Over the last year, we released a new feature within Europeana Collections that links records with a similar creator, place or theme together. Bespoke landing pages show content by a specific person, or on a certain topic, like <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/people/146951-wolfgang-amadeus-mozart.html\">Mozart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/48-photograph.html\">photographs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/95-art-deco.html\">Art Deco</a>. They provide context by combining information from Wikipedia with results relating to a person or topic.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Every year during the Northern summer holidays, approximately 1,000 members of the Wikimedia community – the worldwide group of volunteers and professionals behind projects including <em>Wikipedia</em> and <em>Wikidata</em> – gather for their annual event: <em>Wikimania</em>. This year’s event, hosted in Stockholm, had as its theme the relationship of open-access information to the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/\">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>. The event's program was chaired for the second year running by Europeana’s own Wikimedia liaison Liam Wyatt, in a voluntary capacity. Today he fills us in on this year’s gathering.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A new and diverse format</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019:Program\">program for the three-day main conference</a> consisted of approximately 250 sessions and 300 speakers, scheduled across more than a dozen independently curated ‘spaces’. This format – borrowed loosely from Mozilla’s <em>MozFest</em> conference was a first for the Wikimedia community, and was designed to encourage greater diversity: of content, of session format, and of presenter. Two of these thematic tracks were of particular relevance to Europeana – the GLAM Space, and the Library Space – both of which <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Wikimania_2019\">heavily featured content about Wikidata</a> and included presentations from current and former members of the Europeana Members Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sharing the conference content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Swedish broadcaster <em>Utbildningsradion</em> (UR) produced recordings of the opening day's&nbsp;‘spotlight sessions’ by invited experts discussing their relationship to the theme – from agriculture to mapping, from education to journalism... These are <a href=\"https://urplay.se/serie/213585-ur-samtiden-wikimania-2019\">now available online</a> and soon to be broadcast across national TV. In collaboration with Wikimedia Sweden, and for the first time, UR has also <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_Knowledge_and_the_Global_Goals_Spotlight_Session_%E2%80%93_videos_recorded_by_UR\">released its own footage</a> under a free license (CC By-SA). Video recordings (both official and crowdsourced) of many of the other conference sessions <a href=\"https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019:Video\">have also been made available</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What else was happening?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was a series of <a href=\"https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019:Related_activities\">official side-events to the main conference</a> – both before and afterwards – during which Europeana played a visible role. As part of the series, many local cultural heritage organisations led free guided tours for Wikimania participants, and Europeana partners the <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalmuseum.se/en/\">Nationalmuseum</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.raa.se/\">Riksantikvarieämbetet</a></em> (RAÄ) hosted well-received pre-conference events. The Nationalmuseum led an editathon, while RAÄ hosted <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Events/WMSE_RAA_Europeana_wikidata_workshop\">an all-day training event for 30 small and regional affiliates</a> to learn about how Wikidata can be useful to their organisation. The latter event built on last year’s successful experience <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/what-dutch-glams-want-from-wikidata\">running an equivalent training</a> with Dutch aggregator partner NDE.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>'Wikidata is an excellent tool for working life museums. Through Wikidata and Wikipedia, the cultural heritage of industrial society can be made visible and made available globally.'</em><br />\r\n- attendee feedback from the RAÄ event</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The training included: a general introduction to Wikidata and SPARQL querying; briefings on the impact and development of the ‘structured data on [Wikimedia] Commons’ project; and various GLAM-specific projects built on top of Wikidata – notably the UNESCO-backed <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/FindingGLAMs\">‘FindingGLAMs’ database</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Convening the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/2019_European_GLAMwiki_Coordinators_meeting\">third biennial GLAMwiki Coordinators Meeting</a> during the pre-conference as Europeana’s Wikimedia liaison coordinator, the meeting followed on from the success of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/looking-back-on-the-2nd-european-glamwiki-coordinators-meeting\">2017 edition hosted by UNESCO</a> in Paris. The 2019 meeting was attended by cultural-sector partnership coordinators representing 30 Wikimedia affiliates from across the continent. Each received training and updates on the state-of-the-art tools and processes for effective, efficient and sustainable open-access partnership projects. The training sessions covered: briefings on UNESCO OER recommendations; the Creative Commons certification program; the proposed Open GLAM declaration; and various technical tools currently under development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A third event – focusing on the use of Wikidata and its underlying software <em>Wikibase</em> for National Libraries’ cataloguing needs – was also held. Look out for a follow-up news post later this week&nbsp;with more on that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a summary of all three side-events, check out Wikimedia’s own <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Newsletter/August_2019/Contents/Special_story\">monthly GLAM newsletter</a>.</p>\r\n"

None more so than national libraries, who have been at the forefront of innovations. Thirty institutional representatives participated in this meeting from three continents.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The meeting began with a series of short demonstration talks from institutions already working with Wikidata and Wikibase in-house. These are notable not only for the variety of activities undertaken and the successes already being reported from these young projects, but also for the fact that until recently, they have all been happening largely in isolation with limited knowledge-sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Demonstrations of projects currently underway were given by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru/National Library of Wales (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JfugYJr-rj4_sL2JR0lGzCHbvfCQ3YSpwoGCI2_66Zc\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Kansalliskirjasto/National Library of Finland (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gn-ZXPHCCCFHo8h0BS7nDGoqZMYaqBn7/view?usp=sharing\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Bibliothèque Nationale de France/National Library of France (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwo-9uhtRZwDajY1VXR1ZUZQdjBxRlAwSDQ5Q2NlSG1oZHNZ/view?usp=sharing\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Deutsche Nationalbibliothek/National Library of Germany (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N-isIta29ZdL_wsEbazGmTl0zHbea6YW\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Library of Congress – USA (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iuefk3Zq1kdMjIEt2Wb5Yvk9vkTsPU4sVtvRHjOOHIo/edit#slide=id.p\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Linked Data for Production project (LD4P) – USA (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-KKKDy2EZ1kK1uBIqTns8ydcq1DGlQun/edit#slide=id.p1\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>OCLC – International (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfXqo2Awltqc4576uEofTkzvKySN5apjJHndYM3YuKg/edit?usp=sharing\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Kungliga biblioteket/National LIbrary of Sweden (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FnA-UVe3sFBxxs82nn8Dipa5ve90_KzYp3MGaewnlfg/edit?usp=sharing\">slides</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new director of the National Library of Sweden, Karin Grönvall, on quite literally her first day at the job, also took the time to greet us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heading into the meeting, approximately 40% of the attendees reported that their institution had already undertaken export of their own information into Wikidata. Afterwards, more than 50% reported that as a specific result of what they’d learned they would now investigate undertaking further exports; over 60% also reported they would now be investigating the Wikibase software for in-house use; and 100% of responses received stated a high satisfaction with the day’s usefulness for their institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>‘I found it incredibly helpful to learn more about the Wikidata projects that other institutions are working on, areas in which we could potentially collaborate, and to get a better idea of the future directions of Wikidata and Wikibase to inform our project plans.’</em><br />\r\n- participant survey feedback</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next: the roadmap</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the initial presentations, the meeting moved on to discussions informing – and also getting valuable feedback about – the ‘roadmap’: the forthcoming developments in Wikidata and Wikibase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This began with a section on the work of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iG-rZGmcjjzZnmC36MgKjmbFBaJnX6eR9uz7WgFyOBo/edit\">Structured Data on Commons project</a> – which is bringing the power of linked data to WikimediaCommons – and was followed by in-depth discussions of two specific areas of Wikibase software development that are common requests for libraries: permissions and federation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The former request, permissions, refers to the nuanced read and/or write permissions that cultural institutions would like to provide when managing their own catalogue infrastructure on Wikibase. While in Wikidata the general principle is that everyone can see and edit any part of any item, for libraries this might not be sufficient. Potential outcomes include: designating certain users with advanced permissions to edit specific sections of items, or certain items in entirety; and making certain items or sections of those items visible only to particular users. Having a ‘second opinion’ check-function before a change is published was also discussed. These features might be necessary, for example, in catalogue management where some library staff have the right to edit bibliographic metadata, while other designated staff might have the right to view particularly sensitive information about acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The latter request, federation, refers to the principle that multiple Wikibase instances can work with each other – each containing different information, but being able to sync elements so as not to duplicate effort and in order to propagate up-to-date information. However, as Lydia Pintscher – Wikidata product manager – explained to the group, everyone believes federation is a good idea, however everyone also has a different understanding of what it would mean in practice! In the meeting we talked through various practical options of federated Wikibase including but not limited to: shared properties but local items; shared items but local properties; and shared querying.</p>\r\n"

This latter report provides the specific motivation for why the cultural sector – particularly national libraries – are investigating Wikibase:</div>\r\n\r\n<div><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>‘Wikibase is useful for any kind of heterogeneous data, where connections between the data play an important role. This is relevant for all kinds of fields, starting from (digital) humanities to life sciences. Recently we have seen a lot of activity from the GLAM sector. […] Seven national libraries, among them Germany and France, have run substantial pilots, and libraries from seven more countries have communicated interest in evaluating or using Wikibase or Wikidata as a platform for creating or participating in linked data work for the sector. [...] So far, we have mainly been asking institutions to donate content to us. By fostering a Wikibase Ecosystem, we also have something significant and useful to give back to institutions. This kind of mutually beneficial relationship would strengthen our existing bonds with institutions, and create new partnerships with institutions we haven't reached yet.’&nbsp;</em><br />\r\n- Strategy for the Wikibase Ecosystem, pages 3, 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This strategy is consistent with the Association of Research Libraries extensively researched <a href=\"https://www.arl.org/resources/arl-whitepaper-on-wikidata/\">April 2019 Whitepaper</a> discussing the use of Wikibase and Wikidata in the library context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information about any of the discussions during the Stockholm meeting, please consult the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZYq5-H54K671zdqAoFUgROPzZsT4cfyP11nbdCS_KUw/edit#\">comprehensive notes taken during the day itself</a>.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Our guests&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our first guest was Dr Federica Bressan, who is the power behind the <a href=\"http://technoculture-podcast.com/\">Technoculture</a> podcast - a series of one-on-one conversations with experts in the fields of technology, art, and science.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Up next (in a change to the advertised programme) was Dr Susan Hazan of <a href=\"https://www.imj.org.il/en\">The Israel Museum, Jerusalem</a>, who told us about Visualizing Isaiah. This&nbsp;project that sought to find out how providing context to the biblical Book of Isaiah by presenting it online alongside digitised contemporary objects changed people’s perceptions of the Book.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does it mean to be human? And what do we believe in?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Storytelling, whether it’s digital or otherwise, is all about making connections between people, or between people and ideas. Federica told us that the question Technoculture is trying to answer is ‘What does it mean to be human today?’ Susan talked to us about trying to find out what people believe - do we believe what we see online? Does providing historical context change what we believe about the Book of Isaiah? So, both projects have at their heart an idea about truth and the essence of being human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Linked in with the idea of truth is trust. There’s an awful lot of content on the internet. There are a lot of podcasts, a lot of ‘noise’. Federica says that her approach to cutting through that is to produce the podcast that she wants to produce. ‘You shouldn’t be too eager’, she says. ‘Trust is earned over time. You have to be consistent and believe in the product that you put out there. You believe in what you do and you are transparent and you’re loyal. You’re consistent.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Susan says that the results of the Visualizing Isaiah project are encouraging. Nearly everyone was prepared to suspend their disbelief when presented with historical contextual objects by a museum that they trust. For example, 75% of people were convinced that the David mentioned on a stone inscription held by the museum could be the same David that is referred to in the Isaiah text. Susan says that the results showed that, ‘The trust people have in a museum, we believe, can be transposed into the virtual.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So how can we connect with people?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The idea of connecting people with each other and with ideas came back up in the participants’ questions on how to engage audiences in a podcast or how to encourage local communities to join in an online activity. And again, the answers came back to the concepts of truth and trust - find what is relevant about your activity to your audience, and provide what they need to be able to get to it. So, if you’re making a podcast, you don’t provide just the podcast, but a ‘cloud of items’ around it like transcription text, summary, timed links, more audio or video or pull quotes. And take it to where your audience is - that might be on social media, or it might be at local community groups. Make use of connections that already exist between other groups or organisations and your intended audience. And use your project partners or podcast guests - provide them with ready-made material to share with their networks. Federica even shared some of the tools she uses - see below!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Since January 2015, Europeana has been one of the European Union’s Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI). The EU has several of them, others include safer internet for children, electronic health services, and business management. The Europeana DSI showcases and provides online access to Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage through the Europeana Collections platform and supports cultural heritage institutions as they adapt to this digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the European Commission published an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ten-years-europeana-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-digital-age\">evaluation of Europeana</a>, which outlined our achievements and some areas to focus on next. In this series, we will look at some of the Europeana DSI activities that the evaluation considered a priority, giving you a greater understanding of the endeavours and challenges we’re working on right now.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">The language you speak shouldn’t be a barrier to finding what you want on Europeana Collections but right now, it might be. Find out what we’re doing to put that right.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Collections contains material from galleries, libraries, archives and museums in all 28 EU member countries - and more. You can navigate the website in 27 languages, and it’s easy to search for items described in your own language. But things get more complicated when you want to see items that match your search but are described in a different language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In total, 37 languages are used to describe the collections. However, more than half of all the material (57%) uses one of just five languages - English, German, Dutch, Norwegian or French.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Making an item described in one language turn up in the results or related material when searched for in another language is not easy. And we know we have a long way to go but making positive changes in this area is one of our priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our goal</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want people to find what they’re looking for - even if they’re not using the language that their target item is described in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to increase the chances that searching for something in one language brings up results that match your criteria in another language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Automatic translation is getting better but it isn’t foolproof as you’ll have seen if you’ve ever used an online tool like Google Translate. In the case of Europeana Collections, there are added complications. We’re not concentrating on one specific language being translated into another. We’re working with collections described in 37 languages and trying to match them to search terms that could come in any language. What’s more, metadata isn’t like natural language with full sentences and predictable grammar;&nbsp; it’s often presented in short phrases or even single words meaning that the context required for an accurate translation is hard to find. Adding another layer of complexity is the fact that the terms used can be very specific - they might look like a common term but have a different meaning when used in the context of describing digital cultural material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Automated processes can only work when they are fed the correct and appropriate information. That sounds obvious but as we’ve seen in the earlier posts in this series, the information provided to Europeana varies greatly in terms of its depth and its quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order for anything to be translated, we need to know what language the original element is provided in. Our systems will not guess. So each element (like the title and description) needs a language marker. That’s another layer of information that cultural heritage institutions need to provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we’re doing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New innovations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">This year, we revised our quality standard, the Europeana Publishing Framework, to include standards for metadata in addition to the existing standards for content. Now, it encourages the people who work on metadata to translate elements like titles into multiple languages, and to include context like place names - which are themselves multilingual - from contextual vocabularies (see item below). The Framework also encourages the use of those all-important language tags to show which language is being used. This takes the guesswork out and means that more automatic linking and translation processes can be implemented.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">As well as using expertise from within the Europeana Foundation and Network Association, we rely on the work of others to improve multilingualism on Europeana Collections.&nbsp; In the past year, we carried out a pilot project with the eTranslation team - another European Union-funded DSI project. We're now building on that pilot with further experimentation activities with a view to taking&nbsp;advantage of the project’s automatic translation potential for Europeana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ongoing activities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">When a phrase is given the right context, it’s much easier to translate it. We continue to use metadata enrichment to provide more context for the material you find on Europeana Collections. Our efforts here include the use of ‘contextual vocabularies’, especially those available as Linked Open Data. These datasets give us additional details like multilingual labels, translations of key concepts, or different variants of names for people and places. This makes it easier for people to search for and find items on Europeana Collections. Vocabularies can be used either by data providers or by Europeana as part of various (semi-)automatic metadata enrichment processes.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Europe is multilingual. We need to be too. We’re thankful to our partners and friends for helping us translate important elements like the Europeana Publishing Framework and the rights statements Europeana uses (the information that tells you what you can do with an item you find on Europeana, e.g. is it in copyright or in the public domain?) into more languages. So far, the rights statements have seven translations with six more on the way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Collections website is available in 27 languages, and this year, we released a new exhibition - <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">Heritage at Risk</a> - in seven languages.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What to look out for…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Making Europeana more multilingual is a priority and the subject of a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/multilingualism-in-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana\">two-day event</a> this October under Finland’s presidency of the Council of the EU. The event will see the Europeana Foundation and the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture focussing on needs, expectations and ways forward for multilingualism in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">You can help too. With our partners, we run ‘Transcribathon’ events which invite anyone to join in (either at home online, or at a physical event) and type up the contents of often handwritten text documents so that they can then be more easily accessed and searched, and so they can be machine-translated. In the last year, five transcribathons were organised in cooperation with heritage institutions throughout Europe (Germany, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Romania) and almost 3,000 documents related to the First World War were transcribed.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find out more about our<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\"> automatic enrichments</a> or the European&nbsp;Union’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eTranslation\">eTranslation</a> activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if you’re interested in the fine details of the language element of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, you can also see the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Europeana Publishing Guide</a>, which details exactly what is required when submitting data to Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-tech\">EuropeanaTech</a> has carried out efforts in the area of multilingualism, see for example the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/best-practices-for-multilingual-access\">Best Practices for Multilingual Access</a> and the various presentations on tackling language issues at the last <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeanatech-2018-gorgeous-data-glorious-technology-in-review\">EuropeanaTech conference</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And help make Europeana more multilingual by joining in at <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/\">Transcribathon.eu</a>.

                body: "<p>Marinos is involved in the development of innovative algorithms that can create 3D reconstructions of heritage monuments. His work goes beyond architectural design and modelling, and turns tangible blocks of stones - and their stories - into digital records. It is not an exaggeration to say that the outstanding work Marinos and his team do has the potential to rebuild Europe and its memory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3D - it’s more than geometry</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve been in the cultural heritage sector since the end of the 1980s, when I first started contributing to 3D and digitisation projects during my time as a postdoctoral student in Germany.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My work focuses on the digital documentation, preservation and protection of cultural heritage - in particular architectural structures such as artefacts, monuments and sites. The greatest scientific value of our novel methodologies lies in the holistic heritage documentation of these tangible objects. We create valuable historic records of human knowledge using both geometrical data of billions of 3D point-clouds and a range of 2D and other information often hidden in storytelling, books, drawings, images, maps, and audiovisual material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the greatest challenges scientists face is that there are no internationally recognised standards to holistically document tangible objects in cultural heritage. These are urgently needed. A case in point is the challenge the multidisciplinary experts from around the world are facing with the accurate 3D reconstruction of the Notre-Dame cathedral.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the ViMM (Virtual MultiModal Museums) project, we contributed to the European Commission’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-member-states-sign-cooperate-digitising-cultural-heritage\">Declaration of cooperation on advancing digitisation of cultural heritage</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-day-2019\">Digital-Day 2019</a>, which has been signed by 26 EU Member States. Now, we’re working with the European Commission and international organisations like UNESCO, Europeana, ICOMOS, ICOM, Europa Nostra, ICCROM, EMA, NEMO, CEN, CLARIN, DARIAH, CARARE, Photoconsortium and Michael-Plus to intensify our discussions and set a new standard of sustainable collaboration under the spirit of this Digital Day declaration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The first 3D object in Europeana Collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I was involved 15 years ago in the development of the first 3D object in Europeana Collections - the <a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/2012/05/ministers-on-europeana-giorgos-demosthenous/#.T7YO8P6LOG4.twitter\">Church of Panagia of Asinou</a> in Cyprus, which is a UNESCO World Heritage listed monument. Currently, this is the only existing monument completely recorded to the millimetre and available as a Heritage Building Information Model (HBIM). High-quality results like this have the potential to be used and reused by multidisciplinary groups of professionals and individuals, such as students and tourists.</p>\r\n"

From this information, highly accurate 2D and 3D architectural designs of the building were reconstructed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This initial action laid the foundation for the first ever 3D reverse engineering project in the area of cultural heritage in human history.

From minimal data, working with IBM and other multidisciplinary experts, we contributed our algorithms and knowledge to the digital 3D reconstruction of this remarkable building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1994, at the world’s largest exhibition on ICT (CEBIT) in Hannover, Germany, IBM presented the first ever virtual reality presentation in cultural heritage by illustrating an unforgettable panoramic&nbsp; walk through the Dresden Frauenkirche in a spectacular audiovisual 3D space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifteen years later, using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGLgCODZoiw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">digital crowdsourcing</a>, we created a virtual reconstruction of the same cathedral. This was part of an EU Marie S. Curie funded project named 4D-CH-World.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGLgCODZoiw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Recreating and 3D printing at The Louvre&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in Cyprus in 1996, to commemorate&nbsp; 150 years of its presence in Greece, the French Archaeological Academy of Athens supported the institute I was then working with to digitise in 3D&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.cyprusalive.com/en/the-archaeological-site-of-amathus\">the biggest stone pot in the world</a>. This was the first time a research team with a 3D laser scanner had crossed the doors of the Louvre Museum in Paris. We fully digitised and replicated the Louvre’s third biggest object - <a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/vase-amathus\">a massive stone vase</a> (from the 6th century BC - Height: ~1.90 m and Diameter: ~3.20 m; weight ~14 tons) that had decorated the entrance of the temple of Aphrodite at the&nbsp; top of the hill at the Acropolis in <a href=\"http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/DA/DA.nsf/All/D20ED526826AB796C225719B00374A92?OpenDocument\">the ancient city of Amathus in Cyprus</a>. The temple of Aphrodite was digitally reconstructed by my team and reproduced in Germany using 3D printing technologies at a scale of 1:500. For these very unique achievements, I received the 2010 <a href=\"http://smartheritage.com/premio/2010-awards\">Tartezos Award</a> from the Spanish Society on Virtual Archeology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3D data from an archaeological site to Europeana at the push of a button</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With other multidisciplinary experts for the development of new standards, as well as with the industry, we are working closely with a European 3D Laser manufacturer on the automatic generation of Europeana-ready metadata from 2D information and 3D point cloud structures. This ‘plug and play’ application now in development will accelerate the harvesting of high-quality metadata and content to Europeana.&nbsp; Moreover, we are developing novel cloud-based computing applications for advanced digitisation in museums, archives, libraries and sites. In this way, we are removing current barriers to digital preservation and encouraging small cultural heritage stakeholders to move forward and be part of the digital era.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>A sustainable career in protecting what was lost</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage digital documentation, preservation and protection is a unique multi- and interdisciplinary sector. Thus, this newly established research area (Digital Heritage, or as we define it today: Cultural Informatics) has a distinct character to support and help define the human experience in the humanities and the social sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly established Cyprus University of Technology has been the home of our pioneering Digital Cultural Heritage Research Lab (DHRLab) since 2013. We have received several highly competitive EU grants such as the first <a href=\"https://www.itn-dch.net/\">Marie S. Curie Initial Training Network fellowship project to train 20 PhD fellows in digital cultural heritage</a> (ITN-DCH), for which we were awarded the best Innovation prize at the <a href=\"https://www.eac-events.eu/ehome/fairofeuropeaninnovatorsinculturalheritage/home/\">Innovators Fair on Cultural Heritage </a>during the EU Year dedicated on Cultural Heritage in 2018. ITN-DCH was declared by the European Commission / Research Executive Agency in June 2019 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/rea-10-years-supporting-excellence-science-2019-jun-19_en\">as one of the five Life Changing projects in the last decade (2009-2019).&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s clear this is an area that’s ripe for future investment; it’s encouraging and sustainable. For young people who have 40 years ahead of them in the workplace, it’s a promising field with in-demand jobs and great career opportunities, where you get so much experience and knowledge, by setting new standards and undergoing new challenges for the reconstruction of the past-story. It’s amazing each time you see the results of your work: to reconstruct, preserve and protect what was lost during the evolution of humankind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work</a> brings stories of our personal working lives together with archive material on industrial and labour-related heritage. Looking at our working lives, we can show students and learners that the working world we inhabit today is rich and varied, and tells the story of technological and societal changes over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this series, we look at how <a href=\"https://www.euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a> is using industrial heritage material to create learning resources for educators on their <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana</a> portal. First, we look at their <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/railways-and-connectivity\">Railways and Connectivity source collection</a>, which helps students explore the development of railways over time, consider the different ways in which they were used, and evaluate their impact.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why teach about railways and connectivity?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Railways and connectivity offer a rich opportunity for students to examine the impact of technological change on societies throughout history. With a source collection ranging from the 17th to the 20th centuries, this topic offers valuable examples for teachers seeking to develop students’ historical thinking in the area of continuity and change. The study of railways and connectivity can be easily incorporated into studies of the Industrial Revolution(s), globalisation, or discovery and innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The subject also provides an excellent opportunity to develop student learning in STEM areas, which many curricula increasingly emphasise. The source collection includes examples of the first passenger rail service, and continues on to the development of steam-powered railways and even bullet trains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Railways also provide a useful springboard for an analysis and evaluation of the use and misuse of technologies and their diverse impact on societies. The sources, for example, highlight various positive and questionable uses of railways from economical exploitation, to war, to tourism, to the delivery of aid.</p>\r\n"

Students examine the entire source collection and develop a virtual concept map. They reposition and resize images to show similarities and differences in the impacts of different railways, as well as their relative importance. Students then summarise what they consider to be the most significant impacts of railways since the Industrial Revolution. Students can compare their responses with a partner to see if they arrived at different conclusions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Printing the source collection, with images on one sheet and the relevant information on the other.

                body: "<p>The Europeana Publishing Framework makes it easy for cultural heritage institutions to see how the quality of material and information they provide to Europeana Collections affects how it can be surfaced, showcased, promoted and reused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All cultural heritage institutions are different. Some are big, some small. Some have plentiful resources for working on digital projects, many don’t. Some have staff with technical skill and enthusiasm, some don’t. This results in inconsistencies in the depth and quality of materials on Europeana Collections. The Europeana Publishing Framework is a tool that data partners can use to help improve the quality of information provided. And with higher quality data comes increased benefit&nbsp;for audiences and greater potential use in education, research and the creative industries. In short - the better the content and metadata, the more that can be done with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The addition of guidelines for metadata is the culmination of years of groundwork by the Europeana Foundation, the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and the network of institutions who provide their digital collections. We are grateful to all who have contributed their expertise and are looking forward to seeing collections becoming more reliable, more useful and more visible online as a result of organisations taking the new guidelines to heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">New quality standard increases metadata potential</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on the existing Framework’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Publishing_Framework/Europeana_publishing_framework_content.pdf\">four tiers for content and licensing</a>, we have added three new tiers of quality criteria for metadata. This new component is crucial in making material more easily discoverable - and so increasing its potential for use in education, research and the creative industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The principle behind the metadata tiers (as with the content tiers) is ‘the more you give, the more you get’. The richer and better structured the metadata, the more likely it is that the material will be returned in search results. So adding information about subjects, places, people and time-spans means more people will see, share and use it. And adding information about which language the metadata uses will mean we can help the material to show up even if someone is searching in a different language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the number of language tags and descriptive/contextual elements increases, the higher the tier a record achieves. And with each tier come more benefits - from being returned in search results, to being more likely to be included in thematic collections, marketing activities and more potential for use in apps and services in education, research and the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you work with metadata, you can see exactly what elements are required for each tier in this <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Publishing_Framework/Europeana_publishing_framework_metadata_v-0-8.pdf\">summary</a> chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The metadata tiers have been developed by the Data Quality Committee (DQC) - a working group of the Europeana Network Association and EuropeanaTech community - and are based on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee#discovery-user-scenarios\">real-world discovery and search scenarios</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Quality calculation is a new tool for identifying collections&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every record in Europeana Collections can now be described in relation to its tier for content and metadata. These calculations are not currently shown on the Europeana Collections website but are available to developers in the data served via the Europeana API. This means that developers can make sure that their apps and services only use cultural heritage material that matches their desired quality level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana data partner services team can consult these calculations to look at the quality of particular collections and to chart progress over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We know that improving metadata is a long process. This is no quick fix. But being able to provide an agreed standard of what ‘good’ metadata means for Europeana is a great step. Now, institutions can see how their collections fare and we can support them to improve them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana’s data partner services team is introducing the updated Europeana Publishing Framework to aggregators and data providers through a series of events and workshops.

        intro: "<p>Since January 2015, Europeana has been one of the European Union’s Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI). The EU has several of them, others include safer internet for children, electronic health services, and business management. The Europeana DSI showcases and provides online access to Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage through the Europeana Collections platform and supports cultural heritage institutions as they adapt to this digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the European Commission published an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ten-years-europeana-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-digital-age\">evaluation of Europeana</a>, which outlined our achievements and some areas to focus on next. In this series, we will look at some of the Europeana DSI activities that the evaluation considered a priority, giving you a greater understanding of the endeavours and challenges we’re working on right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Today, we look at what Europeana is doing to take advantage of the advances in digital technology, particularly ‘smart’ technology, that can bring our cultural heritage to life in exciting ways.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having tens of millions of pieces of European art and cultural works available via a website is great, but it’s not enough. There’s so much more we can and should do with them. New and evolving technologies have the potential to help us reveal and use these treasures in smart ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of how much more efficient technology makes us and what that could do to our data ingestion and processing processes. Automation instead of manual manipulation. Fast and efficient processes instead of labour-intensive ones. Machines that learn; machines that get to know our data better than we can. That’s what artificial intelligence and big data could do for us. And if we invest time and effort in their research and set-up, we will be able to tailor developments here and there, repurposing and personalising as needs and demands change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Smart tech can offer culture lovers brand-new visitor experiences, through installations in museums or through apps and online experiences that audiences can access anywhere. High-quality digitised collections can be used to educate, to inform, to entertain, to connect - to support any mission statement a museum might have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Goal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want Europe’s cultural heritage to be found, used, shared and loved. We want to use the most exciting and advanced technologies we can to help Europe’s cultural heritage institutions share their collections in innovative ways, reaching as many people as they can.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Innovative technologies should improve data quality and eliminate some of the time-consuming and expensive manual work that cultural heritage institutions perform at the moment. We hope that by implementing such technologies into Europeana’s processes, we can save our partner institutions significant time and resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The kind of smart tech we’re talking about is dependent on being fed sufficient, accurate, useful data. So, once again, encouraging and supporting cultural heritage institutions to provide high-quality, complete and open data has to be the foundation of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, being smart isn’t all about using advanced technology. We need humans too. Machines can’t (yet) decipher context and relevance in the way that a person can. So we’re looking for human-centric solutions that give us the benefits of today’s tech with that important personal touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What we’re doing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New innovations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana is working with partners on a range of projects that will help to bridge the gap between the present and future for cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balancing tech with the human touch</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />With a project called Enrich Europeana, we want to transform casual users into cultural curators by giving them tools to transcribe, enrich, and add notes and tags to material on Europeana Collections, making it even more useful for culture lovers, educational and research institutions alike. So far, we’ve worked with contributors to design and create a specialised website with transcription and annotation tools. Artificial intelligence looks at the transcribed text, searching for named references that can help bring context to the item. Next will come integration of automatic suggestions for enrichment that are presented to the user within the tool. <a href=\"https://europeana.fresenia.man.poznan.pl/\">Try it now</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">In <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en\">CrowdHeritage</a>, an open platform lets cultural heritage institutions share metadata that might need a little fix or enrichment, and harnesses people power by asking the crowd to contribute with annotations. It also uses artificial intelligence with images to identify, for example, prominent colours in a picture of a dress. <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en\">Try it now</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Making culture accessible to all</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">With St George on a Bike, we’re working to make images more accessible and findable, which is of particular importance to helping&nbsp;visually impaired people to fully appreciate images online. Machine-learning software will ultimately use information contained both in an object's image and in its metadata to create a more complete and useful description of that object. For example, ‘This is a picture of St George on a horse’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ongoing activities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’re always working on improving Europeana Collections and building on past developments to make them even better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">A new browsing experience that’s in development groups material in useful ways, so you can see, for example, all content by a specific person, or on a certain topic, like <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/people/146951-wolfgang-amadeus-mozart.html\">Mozart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/48-photograph.html\">photographs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/95-art-deco.html\">Art Deco</a>. More context is provided by combining information from Wikipedia with results relating to a person or topic. We’re continuing to test and develop this feature so look out for updates.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve been working with partners on collaborative projects applying tech to the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">With partners in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-to-bring-digital-cultural-heritage-to-3d-design-and-virtual-reality\">V4Design</a> project, we’re applying tech like 3D modelling to cultural heritage material so that it can be used in video games.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">As a partner in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=GIFT-project\">GIFT</a> project, we’re finding out how digital formats can be used to develop new ways to explore the museum both as a physical and a digital space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">In 2018, with partners Sound &amp; Vision, we published an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-innovation-agenda\">Innovation Agenda</a>. It includes a list of the most urgent challenges and opportunities across the European cultural landscape - including in technological innovation. By focussing attention on the innovations considered as top priorities, the Agenda hopes to support the sustainable development of a technologically advanced, economically stable and socially conscious cultural heritage domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re at the start of these journeys with smart technology and we’re positive about the changes they can bring about for both the cultural sector and the culture lover. So watch this space for developments as they come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana works with a network of partners and organisations, including <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-tech\">EuropeanaTech</a>&nbsp; - a community of experts, developers, and researchers from the research and development sector - who help ensure we’re not just keeping up with the latest developments, we’re leading them. Read EuropeanaTech’s journal: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-13-ocr\">Insights</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In related work, the Europeana Foundation is involved in <a href=\"https://timemachine.eu/\">Time Machine</a> in which Europeana Collections is one of the building blocks in a project that will, it’s hoped, use artificial intelligence to mass-digitise and interpret archives, to develop visualisation technologies such as augmented reality, and exploitation strategies that will make Europe a leader in the field of innovation using ‘Big Data from the Past’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/\">European Fashion Heritage Association</a> (established in 2014) brings together fashion institutions to encourage the valorisation and reuse of fashion heritage online. It is also an accredited aggregator for Europeana, serving 40 contributing institutions, and last year publishing 870,000 records in Europeana Collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The organisation’s annual conference takes place next month, and - moving on from some of the core issues that emerged in the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2GjAHou\">EFHA International conference 2018</a> - will explore the complexities linked to the definition of fashion heritage. The aim of the conference is to contribute to this ongoing conversation and offer new insights into academic discourse on the role of archives and fashion displays in museums, galleries and the digital realm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Fashion and the Politics of Heritage'&nbsp;will be opened by Marco Rendina, EFHA Managing Director and chair of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, before moving on to a series of panels exploring the encounters between fashion, culture and history. The conference will contextualise the role of politics in these encounters, and investigate the diverse fashion narratives which deal with heritage. It will also focus on the processes of framing these narratives, and directly explore the practices of archiving and preserving fashion. The conference will gather professionals from some of the most established museums and fashion archives to reflect on their day-to-day practices, <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />and finally will analyse queer heritage between academia and the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first panel of the conference, on ‘Questioning Heritage and Fashion’, is dedicated to cultural heritage in its material and digital forms, and includes a talk from Dr. Marie Riegels Melchior (University of Copenhagen) which discusses <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a> and the Google Cultural Institute’s ‘We Wear Culture’. It will explore why two of the largest international cultural heritage digitisation platforms have chosen fashion as themes, and the importance they afford to the digital preservation and communication of fashion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The line-up of speakers also includes academics Julia Petrov, Rhonda Garelick and Fabio Cleto, museums such as Centraal Museum Utrecht and the Museum of London, and brand archives from Missoni, Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood and Ermenegildo Zegna. Their presentations will tackle a variety of issues, including: cultural heritage in its material and digital forms, with reference to Europeana’s role in its dissemination; the management and role of archives for either museums or brands; the relationship between material culture and digital technologies; and the meaning of ‘politics’ in the context of the archive.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Powering sustainable knowledge in the digital age</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Executive Director of <a href=\"https://libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a> - the Association of European Research Libraries - I implement our strategy and manage our network of 450 libraries across 42 countries, as well as the office of seven staff in The Hague. Our strategy is about progressing the open science cause and powering sustainable knowledge in the digital age. We envision a world in 2022 in which open access will be the dominant form of publishing. A world in which research data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).&nbsp; We believe that by developing digital and participatory skills for research, the cultural heritage of tomorrow can be built on today’s digital information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nFrom ‘boutique digitisation’ to a truly digital library</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to work for the Koninklijke Bibliotheek - the National Library of the Netherlands - in 2001, at the beginning of digitisation. I used to call it ‘boutique digitisation’ - we were exploring techniques, working on just a few special items and displaying them on the internet, which was also just at its beginnings. Slowly, the projects became bigger. At first we just scanned images - there was no full-text, no Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Then the projects became bigger and we started talking about mass digitisation, not just of books but also newspapers. We ran a project called Impact which looked into OCR for historical texts. The library transformed from a physical to a digital library. I became a programme manager to oversee that very exciting period. The aim was to digitise all of the books in the KB. When I left two years ago, we had digitised about 60% of all books and made them available on the KB’s online research platform, <a href=\"https://www.delpher.nl/\">Delpher</a>. They’re still working on the other 40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIBER is a different world - it’s about research libraries. The focus on digitisation has disappeared a little as it has become business as usual. Now we focus more on changing the culture within research libraries towards open science - that is, open access for published research. We want to change the research cycle so that it always starts with how data is being produced and managed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Artificial intelligence for libraries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started working in the cultural heritage sector, digitisation or working in digital ways was still a niche. Libraries were about physical books. Now, I think digital is the norm for the majority of people working in libraries. Now libraries are starting to look at the next thing - artificial intelligence. Libraries organise information and we still do parts of that manually but AI could help with things like the automation of creating metadata. AI is not going to make people unnecessary but the core business of libraries is information and AI will certainly change the way we help our users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nThe challenge of changing research culture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our biggest challenge is to really change the culture of researchers and how research is done. Researchers are not really aware of how their data can be reused. You used to publish on paper; it was all printed. Now, researchers use big data, digital techniques, they publish in electronic journals. If you want to make research sustainable and available for the next generations, then from the very start of your research, you have to make sure your data is reusable, and that your publications are open access. But that culture is difficult because researchers are still measured in traditional ways. What counts is how many publications you make in certain journals. We need to reconsider this. This cultural change is one of the biggest challenges we have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The importance of working together through this digital transformation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If I say digital is normal now, that’s not entirely true, certainly not if you look at the whole of Europe. Some countries are far less developed in the digital transformation than others. The advice I would give to my younger self would be - pay more attention to your surroundings and try harder to take others with you. I don’t think people were ready for the cultural change that the digital transformation requires. It’s very important that you keep an eye on old traditions and ways of working, and not assume that everybody has gone through this digital transformation already.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are very proud of the LIBER network - it’s a very strong network and in two years’ time, we will celebrate its 50th anniversary. It’s a very tight network because research libraries cannot operate by themselves. They need this network to keep on existing because sometimes libraries come up against the question ‘Why do you still need libraries if you have all this information on the internet?’ But they still have an important role, giving access to information in a careful way. This network is aware of that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m very fond of libraries - it’s very important that people have access to information and if possible, free access to information - that’s a very important value of life and it’s still not the case. Without it, you cannot grow or develop. The work that I’ve done at the KB and in LIBER helps to progress that goal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Look out for reflections&nbsp;on this event later this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, how much Finnish material is there? <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=Finland&amp;view=grid\">Over&nbsp;one million items</a>&nbsp;in Europeana Collections come from a total of 11 Finnish institutions, and more than half of them are openly licensed. The biggest contributor at over 500,000 items is the National Library of Finland. Soon, the Finnish people will be able to add to that count as they are invited to share their own working life stories through three Europe at Work collection days.</p>\r\n"

We want people all over Europe (and beyond) to contribute their own stories - in their own languages - either online or at collection days held in museums, libraries and other cultural institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europe at Work - our current participatory campaign - shares the story of Europe through our working lives in the past and the present. Events are taking place across Europe from now until the end of the year. Three of those are happening in Finland over the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">30 October 2019 -<a href=\"http://www.fiskarsmuseum.fi/en\"> Fiskars Museum</a>. This local museum is collaborating with the National Library of Finland and Europeana on a collection day that marks the 70th anniversary of the Fiskars Museum. The museum is housed in Fiskars former ironworks - established in 1649 - and preserves and shares ironworks culture from the 17th century to the present day. The general public are invited to share stories of work and working lives - past and present - in Fiskars, in particular at the Fiskars ironworks. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/492687751282222/\">See the Facebook event here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">28 November - <a href=\"https://tekniikanmuseo.fi/\">Museum of Technology,</a> Helsinki. This museum’s collections represent the story of Finland from its time as an agrarian society to it becoming a leading developer and producer of high tech to a global market.&nbsp;The theme of the&nbsp;collection day is professions and the cultural heritage of technology. The museum is inviting people&nbsp;who work as IT specialists, surveyors and graphic industry professionals.&nbsp;Kirsi Ojala, Director of Collections at the Museum of Technology, will open the event with a talk and there will also be a discussion on how to record your own career and share your memories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">28 November - <a href=\"https://www.varkaus.fi/museot\">Museums of Varkaus</a>. The Varkaus Museum and Varkaus Art Museum present both history and art with a special focus on industrial community, industrial history and environments. The collection day there&nbsp;will focus on the memories of people who work or worked&nbsp;with the automotive industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Share with your networks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europe at Work collection events continue until the end of the year. Please join us in promoting them to your own networks and encouraging people to share their stories with us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Since 2000, I have been the Secretary General of Europa Nostra - the largest pan-European federation of heritage organisations. As such, I am responsible for the strategic and policy leadership of the organisation. My role entails supervising, coordinating and providing strategic guidance to all activities implemented by Europa Nostra, as well as nurturing relations and partnerships with heritage organisations and institutions at all levels of governance. Let me add that this is much more than a job, this has become a true mission of my life. I see my task as building bridges and pulling down walls - visible and invisible - between countries, communities and citizens in Europe, through the cohesive power of our shared cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past decades, a lot has changed in the cultural heritage world. The two biggest - and most favourable - changes are: 1) a much wider understanding of the notion of cultural heritage, and 2) a greater public recognition of its value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Towards a more inclusive understanding of cultural heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the first point, Europa Nostra was established in 1963 with the objective of ‘safeguarding monuments, sites and habitats of artistic, historic or natural interest’. Ever since, however, our activities have evolved and enlarged - and will continue doing so - keeping pace with the evolution of heritage knowledge and practice and to reflect an ever more inclusive understanding of cultural heritage. Today, Europa Nostra aims to be THE voice for cultural heritage in Europe, and our work covers cultural heritage in its broadest understanding: from natural to tangible, intangible or digital - in partnership with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europa Nostra, we support the digitisation of cultural heritage in different ways, including by celebrating and promoting excellence in this field, notably through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeanheritageawards.eu/\">European Heritage Awards / Europa Nostra Awards</a>. An inspiring project that has received this prestigious Award is the digitisation of <a href=\"http://www.europeanheritageawards.eu/winners/digitisation-naturalis-biodiversity-centers-collection-leiden/\">Naturalis Biodiversity Center’s</a> collection in Leiden (the Netherlands), where nine million zoological, botanical and geological specimens from across the globe were digitised, facilitating further research and allowing the public to discover this collection. Another remarkable project is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeanheritageawards.eu/winners/romarchive-digital-archive-roma-germany/\">RomArchive</a>, a digital archive created by Roma people themselves to make their culture and heritage visible. This is one of our most recent award winners and we shall celebrate it on 29 October at the special heritage evening at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also support the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage by building partnerships with key stakeholders. Earlier this year, Europa Nostra and ViMM (Virtual Multimodal Museum) signed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/europa-nostra-and-vimm-virtual-multimodal-museum-sign-a-joint-statement-stressing-the-role-of-digital-technologies-for-the-future-of-cultural-heritage/\">Joint Statement</a> stressing the role of digital technologies for the future of cultural heritage. The statement was prepared as ViMM’s response to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Berlin-Call-Action-Cultural-Heritage-Future-Europe.pdf\">Berlin Call to Action ‘Cultural Heritage for Future of Europe</a>’, launched by Europa Nostra, the German Cultural Heritage Committee (DNK) and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) in 2018 on the occasion of the European Year of Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we have an excellent dialogue with Europeana (we both have our headquarters in The Hague!) both bilaterally and through Europeana’s active participation in the European Heritage Alliance 3.3. coordinated by Europa Nostra’s Brussels Office. Together with Europeana, we are also involved in the development of the Time Machine Project which will hopefully be implemented at the European level with the vital support of the European Union.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As all these examples show, our mission and ambition is to build bridges between different heritage disciplines, and between heritage and the wider world beyond the traditional heritage field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Public recognition of cultural heritage as a strategic resource for Europe</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the second important change, the last few years have seen significant progress in the public recognition of cultural heritage as a strategic resource for Europe, with the designation of 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage being a real turning point. For Europa Nostra, as well as for other heritage organisations that have been, throughout these years, raising awareness and advocating for a more prominent role of cultural heritage in the political agenda, this feels like a true victory and a confirmation that our joint efforts can bear fruits! Indeed, ‘l’Union fait la force’!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Year was an historic accomplishment: it saw an unprecedented Europe-wide mobilisation of heritage stakeholders - both public and private - and encouraged the participation of citizens and communities across the continent. It also led to much larger engagement in heritage by all EU Institutions and a stronger awareness about the huge potential that cultural heritage has for the future of Europe, and this in many policy areas. As a result, cultural heritage was recognised as the ‘cross-cutting priority’ for Europe. I am proud to say that Europa Nostra’s work and advocacy efforts were instrumental for and during the EYCH, and it was a real pleasure to collaborate with so many stakeholders, including Europeana, to make this year a success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The challenge of funding</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the greatest challenges of the heritage sector remains finding the necessary and sustainable sources of funding, in particular for organisations working on a non-profit basis. For a long time, the heritage circles have heavily relied on the public sector. Although a stronger commitment of governmental institutions at all levels of governance remains indispensable, we must also involve the private sector as much as possible, and ensure closer cooperation between the two. There are many funding opportunities for heritage at EU level too, but not all organisations possess the human resources or knowledge required to access them. In particular, there is a deplorable gap when it comes to funding small-scale projects - with the potential of having a big impact! To tackle this issue, heritage stakeholders shall have to continue exploring untapped and innovative sources of income, such as corporate support, philanthropy and donations by foundations, crowdsourcing and corporate social responsibility programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Connecting the dots of collective intelligence</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another great challenge of the sector is to capitalise on the immense collective intelligence that we have produced over the past years, and to connect all those infinite dots out there! We have achieved so much in terms of policy developments, successful projects and practices. So much that we should not try to ‘reinvent the wheel’ every time: instead, we should build on the foundations of what has already been achieved. We should share, as much as possible, information and good practice among practitioners to avoid duplication of effort.&nbsp; And we shall build as many partnerships as possible!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advice to my younger self – and to every young heritage professional – is related to this last point: trust in the transformative power of partnerships - we are stronger together!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Historical topics in ‘The Age of Synergies’&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Historiana collection<a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/the-age-of-synergies\"> The Age of Synergies</a> consists of material (sourced from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a>)&nbsp;on the Second Industrial Revolution, which took place between 1870 and 1914. During this time, the increasing use of steam power and electricity, both fuelled by fossil fuels, led to significant changes in production, communication and transportation. These changes, in turn, led to demographic developments and increasing globalisation. Such innovations in energy use have given rise to the description of the period as an ‘Age of Synergies.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This source collection aims to help students understand the connections between different energy uses, how they have influenced each other and what the consequences of technological innovation may be. It also explores the concept of cumulative causation, a theory developed by the economist Gunnar Myrdal in 1956. The theory suggests that change is the result of the interplay between several important causes that not only coincide, but accelerate and increase each other. This understanding of cause and consequence can help students to explore the Second Industrial Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you teach The Age of Synergies?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In addition to Historiana’s source collection on The Age of Synergies, they have developed an <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/student/view/1ebb02b0-43f1-4be8-8329-b8074e368d59/text/bb_0\">e-Learning activity</a> that uses digitised industrial heritage material to help students explore cumulative causation and the developments of the Second Industrial Revolution. The activity asks them to investigate the relationship between historical cause and consequence to produce a coherent narrative of the period’s synergies.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">In the first part of the activity, students use a sorting tool to link different sources (which represent developments such as the increasing use of electricity and changes in transport, communication and population) by their direct and indirect connections. For example, electricity directly led to the invention of the electric motor (direct), which in turn led to changes in transportation (indirect). Students can summarise their findings in a short paragraph.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">In the second part, students again look at the sources and use a prioritising tool to think about the significance of each development in relation to the others. The more significant a development is, the larger students can make it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">In the third and final part, students again use a sorting tool to re-examine the sources. They will need to make connections between different developments to form a coherent narrative of the cumulative causation that took place during the Second Industrial Revolution. A teacher could use this part of the learning activity to discuss the complex and constructivist nature of history as a science.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Explore <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/industrial-heritage\">industrial heritage on Europeana Collections</a> and find more teaching resources including units, source collections and eLearning activities on the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana </a>website.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Rise of Literacy in Europe project explored written text in European culture to tell the story of the development of European literacy. Through the project, participating partners selected, digitised, and ingested new textual content on the Europeana platform, and enriched and improved data for material already hosted on Europeana. Highlights of these written cultural treasures included extraordinary illuminated codices such as the Gutenberg Bible, handwritten letters from famous European poets and major European newspapers of the mid-20th century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Participating in the project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">13 European cultural heritage organisations - mostly national libraries - were part of the project consortium, which encouraged collaboration around the digitisation of cultural heritage. For the National and University Library of Slovenia, participation in, and coordination of, the project was a great privilege and invaluable experience. It was fantastic to be connected with colleagues from all over Europe, and work together on irreplaceable textual knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the project&nbsp;we established strong ties with other partners, which will have a positive impact on future work. It was a great opportunity for exposure, networking&nbsp;and knowledge sharing - which provides motivation for keeping the partnership alive beyond the funding period!&nbsp;The development and application of best practices and the network established by the Rise of Literacy project will support capacity building and the further harmonisation of digital textual collections at a European and international level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alongside the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/our-mission\">Europeana Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nuk.uni-lj.si/eng/\">National and University Library of Slovenia</a>, 11 cultural heritage institutions were involved as partners: the <a href=\"https://www.nlg.gr\">National Library of Greece</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/en\">Royal Library of the Netherlands</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.nb.rs/?change_lang=en\">National Library of Serbia</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/en\">National Library of France</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.nls.uk\">National Library of Scotland</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.lnb.lv/en\">National Library of Latvia</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.bnportugal.gov.pt/index.php?lang=en\">National Library of Portugal</a>; the <a href=\"https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/en/\">Berlin State Library</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.ovi.cnr.it/index.php/en/\">Italian National Research Council - Opera del Vocabolario Italiano</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.iccu.sbn.it/en/\">Central Institute for the Union Catalogue of Italian Libraries and for Bibliographic Information</a>; and the <a href=\"https://www.library.wales/\">National Library of Wales</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Achievements</strong></h3>\r\n"

They provided an additional 170,205 improved pre-digitised objects for publication on Europeana Collections throughout the course of the project. This high-quality content is mostly available for non-commercial or open reuse, supporting the accessibility of digital cultural heritage objects available through Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contributing to thematic collections&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The material identified by project partners and expert knowledge from consortium partners supported the creation of the queries essential to producing two thematic collections - Manuscripts and Newspapers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/manuscripts\">Europeana Manuscripts Collection</a> brings together high-quality resources from major European libraries, offering a reference point for researchers and the wider public to explore manuscripts from antiquity to the early print era. To date, it provides access to more than 480,000 documents from over 464 institutions across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second collection supported by The Rise of Literacy project, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/newspapers\">Europeana Newspapers</a>, is currently one of the largest collections of digitised historical newspapers in Europe, providing access to around four million fully searchable digital historical newspapers content from 50 major national and research libraries in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Editorial&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In close collaboration with the Europeana Foundation, the National Library of Scotland coordinated the production and publication of editorials connected with the Rise of Literacy in Europe. At the end of the project, this included&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/tag/rise-of-literacy/\">29 blogs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/alphabets\">6 galleries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics.html?theme=manuscripts\">19 browse entry points</a>, and an online exhibition - <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/rise-of-literacy-in-europe#ve-anchor-intro_16363-js\">The Rise of Literacy in Europe</a> - which was curated by the National Library of Latvia. Partners contributed content on diverse topics including early modern teaching materials, children’s books, bestsellers, and the history of reading. The exhibition was well received, with 3,000 visitors within its first three weeks of opening, and continues to be available to visitors to Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A second exhibition is scheduled for 2020, and more blogs and galleries written and curated by the project partners will be published on Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n"

One of the greatest goals of ECC is to increase content and metadata quality in Europeana Collections, so we wanted to explore how we could share information around these topics to help museums and cultural heritage institutions enhance their data quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The webinar series<a href=\"https://www.raa.se/in-english/events-seminars-and-cultural-experiences/open-digital-heritage/\"> ‘Open GLAM now!’</a> (which runs from November - December 2019) is our way of addressing these issues and supporting digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector. Open GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) is an international movement around open cultural heritage data. Our webinars take an introductory approach to the topic, and hope to encourage new institutions and partners interested in delivering data to work with us as the Swedish national aggregator for Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Topics, speakers and timings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The webinars cover a wide variety of topics. The session ‘Work Together’ will address how an institution can join existing open cultural heritage projects. Others, such as the session on copyright and open licensing, will help our existing partners to reflect on their licensing policies. It might prompt them to consider opting for more open rights statements, which would increase their data quality according to the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\"> Europeana Publishing Framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many speakers in these sessions are either Europeana Foundation staff or members of the Europeana Network, including Europeana Foundation Collections Managers Adrian Murphy and Douglas McCarthy, and GLAM-Wiki Coordinator for Europeana, Liam Wyatt.</p>\r\n"

Neither speakers nor participants have to travel to join the meeting, which makes this series both comparably environmental-friendly and accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We scheduled the webinars every week, starting with introductory topics on the Open GLAM movement and picking up more advanced subjects later in the series. As the sessions last around 90 minutes, they are easier to fit into your calendar than a whole workshop or conference. You can also choose to take part in those webinars which suit your needs best – and if you cannot make it, you can still watch the recorded sessions and read the documentation related to the presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making knowledge accessible</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The documentation of the webinar will be a crucial aspect of this series, as it will be openly accessible on the Swedish National Heritage Board’s website. Participants and people interested in open cultural heritage will be able to find information about the topics featured in the series even after it finishes. Making this knowledge accessible for the cultural heritage sector and creating a resource to inform institutions about the possibilities of open data will be valuable even after the ECC project.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Introducing RE:VIVE workshops - reusing and remixing archival sounds'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The RE:VIVE initiative, run by The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, brings together archives and artists to create new content\_out of and inspired by the abundance of audiovisual materials which reside in archives. In this post, Greg Markus tells us about the online workshops the initiative has been running to promote their reuse.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The lockdown and social distancing measures which countries around the world have faced as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis have changed all aspects of our lives, including how we listen to and consume music. From March 12 in the Netherlands, concerts were cancelled, musicians could not perform in venues, and DJ sets, alongside tours, house shows and gallery openings, were no longer possible.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/projects/revive\">RE:VIVE</a>, an initiative run by <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> - the national media archive of The Netherlands - we saw multiple new challenges emerge for this vibrant industry. RE:VIVE works with electronic music to create new pieces made out of, inspired by, for or based on all things cultural heritage. From <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/resampling-archival-recordings-to-give-old-stories-new-electronic-life-an-intro-to-re-vive\">film scores</a> to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/from-heritage-collections-to-the-dance-floor-sampling-archival-material-with-re-vive-1\">new</a> <a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/2017/06/the-music-of-machines/\">albums</a>, to new technologies and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/tech-and-music-forever-and-always-the-perfect-couple\">educational programming</a>, RE:VIVE has been bringing cultural heritage to new audiences in various forms for nearly four years.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the initial shock and the realisation that that the many festivals and events we had planned for the coming six months were either cancelled or going to be cancelled, we had to think about how to continue promoting the re-use of archival material in a manner that wasn’t forced and that benefited the participants, the archive and the artists.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bringing our events online</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with our colleague <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/torguenl\">Torgue</a> (Giacomo Piscitelli), a music producer and lecturer at the SAE Institute Amsterdam who has regularly given RE:VIVE workshop over the past for years, we decided to use the SAE’s premium Zoom account to give free\_Virtual Sound Design Workshops.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An in-person RE:VIVE workshop is fairly straightforward. We curate a set of openly licensed archival sounds and invite Torgue and one or two other artists to make a new song out of it. They share their work process and tips and tricks for how you can turn an ambulance siren into a house melody, for instance. Then the participants take the sounds, their new knowledge and in a few hours, try to make a piece of music as well. The workshops are easy to organise, inexpensive, simple, and most of all, fun.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, no one would want to attend a five hour online workshop where the bulk of the time is spent making music on a laptop, so we decided to turn the workshops into lectures. Through these, we could also support our peer musicians and artists at a challenging time for the industry, as well as share learning with our followers.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the first workshop we decided to invite guest lecturers as well, so Torgue and one other guest would share different production methods for processing sounds. We’re now seven workshops in and have welcomed nearly 250 participants, with <a href=\"https://revivethis.org/virtual-workshop-8-know-v-a/\">more workshops</a> to follow in June.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sharing our learning\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing we did or are doing is ingenious, but we’ve tried to respond with agility, to allow us to experiment in a new medium, work with artists, encourage the re-use of archival material and most importantly, create a space where people could come together to explore and create music for 90 minutes a week.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops have had a good response - participants keep coming back, and they bring friends! Even some of the presenters have come to attend later workshops because they enjoyed their one so much. We’ve seen sample pack downloads (<a href=\"https://revivethis.org/sample-packs/\">curated sets of openly licensed archival materials</a>) double and website traffic triple in just a few weeks.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that community engagement isn’t a one-way street. It’s a dialogue. With these virtual workshops (which we intentionally cap at 50 participants) we’re able to always engage with artists and participants, and get their thoughts and input to the process.\_<br>\r\nWe would love to involve other institutes in these workshops, and help them to show off their archival collections to our community and let people travel virtually to a new sonic world or time. We have an open call to heritage institutes with openly licensed audio collections to get in contact and share your collections, so if you would like to get involved, <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">get in touch</a>. If you would like to attend the workshops, <a href=\"https://revivethis.org/virtual-workshop-8-know-v-a/\">sign up now.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Building capacity for digital transformation: how our workshops support the cultural heritage sector'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana’s ‘Digital Transformation in the time of COVID-19’ workshops began this week, bringing together thought leaders in the cultural heritage sector for sense-making, scaling-up and capacity building. With the workshops underway, we share how they contribute to Europeana’s strategic priorities to build capacity for the sector and how you can follow and benefit from the work they undertake.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Digital change and digital need in the cultural heritage sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Europeana Initiative has been actively supporting the digital transformation of cultural heritage since 2008, in the last few months we have seen a rapid acceleration of digital activities in cultural heritage organisations. A recent <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/fileadmin/Dateien/public/NEMO_documents/NEMO_Corona_Survey_Results_6_4_20.pdf\">NEMO survey </a>reveals that during the lockdown in Europe, over 60% of museums increased their online activities, providing a vital lifeline to the audiences they serve. This quick and creative response shows that our sector has the elasticity to take action in times of need.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, we have all become acutely aware that a solid digital strategy entails much more than simply adding content online. It requires a fundamental understanding of the relationship we want to have with our audiences, of digital skills, and the ability to evaluate choices such as which platforms to use. If we consider that the crisis required staff in many institutions to pick up responsibilities for digital processes that they had never been trained for, we see the emerging need for cultural heritage institutions to be able to develop, and build on, that capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently launched <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a> looks to address this need. The strategy imagines a cultural heritage sector powered by digital and empowered to make that digital change by Europeana, and prioritises digital capacity building for our sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While an acceleration of digital change is evident and the need for embedding digital practices, digital skills and literacy is apparent, understanding what interventions are needed to support these changes is not so simple. For Europeana to develop training programmes, workshops or seminars that make a difference, we need to consult our community. How does your perspective towards digital transformation change because of COVID-19? Which areas have been most affected, and how can your organisation cope with that? How does a looming economic crisis impact your willingness and ability to change?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Supporting digital transformation through our workshops</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have developed a phased project to help us identify and shape a capacity-building framework based on the needs of our sector. Our special workshop series around ‘Digital Transformation in the time of COVID-19’ contributes to this work.\_ The series calls upon our community to bring their perspective, experience and expertise together to identify new paths through - and beyond - the COVID-19 crisis for digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, 60 participants drawn from across the Europeana network will meet in groups for three peer-to-peer workshops. Each week the group will examine a different aspect of digital transformation as seen through the lens of the COVID-19 crisis, gathering a range of perspectives from participants. And just as we hope these workshops will help to contribute towards the participant’s work in their own institutions, we hope they will also contribute towards Europeana’s work as we gain a greater understanding of the sector’s changing needs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noted digital strategists and innovators <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-peter-edson-6582291/\">Michael Peter Edson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspervisser1982/\">Jasper Visser</a> are facilitating the workshops, and describe the value they see in the approach:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike says, ‘The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing crisis act as a magnifying glass for trends and developments in our sector. In this way, COVID-19 has a lot to teach us about the capacity of Europe’s GLAM institutions to be responsive and serve their audiences in a time of rapid change. Jasper and I have designed these workshops with the conviction that Europeana’s Network and community members, working together, can see and understand more than any textbook or TV pundit ever can.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jasper adds, ‘We've set up the workshops from the profound belief that if we are to address digital transformation successfully, we'll need to bring everyone to the table. The diversity of experiences and perspectives from the participants who come from all over Europe and the sector are invaluable as we tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. It's incredibly exciting to bring so many minds together.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get involved and follow our work</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to share the progress and outcomes of these workshops with those of you who cannot participate directly. Over the next three weeks, we will document the discussions and topics from the workshops in posts for <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro News</a>, and invite our readers to consider a topic of importance in relation to the workshops. You can share your thoughts and follow the progress on Twitter through the hashtag #BuildDigitalCapacity. In time, we will share the full results of these workshops alongside a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-digital-transformation-across-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">report from Culture24</a>, which seeks to gain a greater understanding of digital transformation across our sector, with our audiences.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if you want to receive direct updates about our work and be the first to hear about opportunities to get involved, you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up to the Europeana Network Association</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19: exploring the immediate impact'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Throughout June, Europeana is bringing together 60 cultural heritage professionals from across Europe for a special series of peer-to-peer workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, one of the process’s facilitators, Jasper Visser, shares a few of the topics which emerged in the first week of the workshops focusing on the immediate impact of COVID-19 and asks you to reflect on your own experience of the crisis.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>COVID-19 has changed the daily practice of cultural heritage organisations across the continent. The sector changed visibly — <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/news/article/nemo/nemo-report-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-museums-in-europe.html\">museums</a> closed, <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/covid-19-and-libraries\">libraries</a> moved part of their services online, teams work from home. And it changed in more subtle ways — organisational hierarchies shifted, while working from home has meant that the boundaries between the personal and the professional blurred even further. The thinking behind Europeana’s sense-making process about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">digital transformation in times of COVID-19</a> is that all these changes combined provide insights into possible futures for digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first week of the sense-making workshops, we explored the immediate impact of the COVID-19 crisis on individuals, teams, organisations, and our audiences. We did so collaboratively. The 60 participants observed how COVID-19 affected them and their organisations, then collectively reflected on this and ultimately joined in an exploration of our shared and unique experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found in this first week is that the crisis is affecting everyone differently. The stories and experiences of the 60 participants are all unique to their country, organisation and personal and professional circumstances. Although we appear to be going through a shared moment in time, there are many ways in which we experience it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that there is wisdom in this diversity in our sector. While we prepare for a successful digital future, we shouldn’t look for one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we need to understand our sector’s full potential and the entire range of challenges. A few examples of the ways in which the experience of COVID-19 has been different for participants that surfaced in the workshops so far include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Some European countries were fully prepared for public services to go digital and others are still struggling with the essentials.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Some organisations quickly developed new digital audience services and some experienced an almost complete disconnect with their community.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The crisis seems to reinforce existing hierarchies in some organisations and others have seen relationships along the chain of command relax.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Digital teams have moved to the heart of some GLAMs, and in others, digital has become a shared responsibility of everyone in the organisation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Even our most digitally conservative colleagues now observe the great potential of digital for our organisation, and we’re also seeing the risks of digital pollution.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Working from home enables participants to be more productive and many of us are also digitally fatigued.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We can have sustained conversations about the digital transformation of cultural heritage and also lack a common vocabulary to talk about it.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These apparent paradoxes highlight that within the GLAM sector different realities exist at the same moment. One organisation’s strength is another organisation’s challenge. To tap into the full potential of Europe’s GLAMs we’ll need to find approaches to catalyse our strengths while we collectively address our challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what about you? We’ve found that people’s individual experience during recent months is shaped by personal circumstances, working conditions, and by other factors. What are the factors that have shaped your experience of the COVID-19 crisis so far and ability to be successful and satisfied in your job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please share your thoughts about the factors that shaped your experience of the COVID-19 crisis on Twitter with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildDigitalCapacity\">#BuildDigitalCapacity</a>. Feel free to tag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">@Europeanaeu</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpedson\">@mpedson</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaspervisser\">@jaspervisser</a> as well. Your insights and ideas will help us shape the conversations and outcomes of this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming weeks, we will try to learn much more about the diversity of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the participants in the sessions, we will try to discover and analyse patterns and shared characteristics of our strengths and our challenges. Together, we will look to understand the complex dynamics of what enabled some GLAMs to face the crisis proactively while others struggle, and what success actually means and looks like for digital cultural heritage in a post-COVID-19 world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for your contributions and we look forward to our continued working together to understand the full digital potential of GLAMs.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Inefficiencies in technical infrastructure make it harder for institutions to share their collections online effectively. To counter this challenge, the Europeana Initiative will invest in supporting innovation activities that keep the infrastructure aligned with state-of-the-art tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A more efficient aggregation infrastructure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first infrastructure we’re talking about in this context refers to the mechanisms and processes that aggregators and their networks of cultural heritage institutions use to provide and share cultural heritage material - that’s getting data and content into Europeana. Europeana has already developed an in-house bespoke system for efficient ingestion of data and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chair of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, Marco Rendina, was one of the members of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\">Expert Group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana (DCHE)</a> that produced the recommendations this strategy is based on. Marco says, 'The release of an efficient and shared ingestion platform has been long-awaited by aggregators in order to speed-up and streamline the publication process on Europeana. In the new Europeana strategy, this has become one of the top priorities, and it will lead to an improved aggregation infrastructure that will be accessible directly by aggregators, and later on potentially also by institutions, for the ingestion, validation, enrichment and publication of cultural heritage content in the Europeana collections platform, overcoming the actual bottlenecks and finally making it easy and rewarding for cultural heritage institutions to share their content in Europeana.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Better connected content&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, there’s a layer of infrastructure that makes the collected data and content accessible. Here we’re talking about APIs that support the use of material in other sectors like education, research and the creative industries. The set of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana APIs</a> will be improved, documented further&nbsp;and promoted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond just API access though, developments will extend the 'entity' collections, which link items to concepts that include topics, people, places&nbsp;and organisations. This provides the backbone for the Europeana collections website’s new browsing experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Content that's easier to find and browse</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, once data and content is available on Europeana, it needs to be easy to find and browse. Work in this area will include further developments to the functionality on the Europeana collections website as well as making Europeana content more accessible to search engines. And giving people using the site more options to create, organise and save collections for their own use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dasha Moskalenko, Europeana Foundation’s Manager for Service Experience says, ‘We want to make it easier for people to explore and interact with our abundant collection of cultural heritage items. We want people to quickly find what they are looking for and get inspired by content that they didn't know existed. In the coming five years, we will challenge ourselves to design an experience that will immerse people&nbsp;in our shared cultural heritage. They will discover relationships between items located across institutions and countries and learn how our cultures connect, the similarities between them, and find understanding for our differences.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>As part of the project, development focused primarily on the user experience for audio and video content. Europeana aggregates material from a huge variety of collections and organisations across the European continent. The way you encounter video on the site can therefore differ enormously. You could move from looking at a high-resolution video embedded from YouTube or Vimeo to looking at a stamp-sized Flash video item uploaded more than a decade ago. We aimed to improve this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Building on the EUscreen player</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We did! Back in 2015 we launched the current <a href=\"http://euscreen.eu\">EUscreen portal</a>, which offers free online access to thousands of items of audiovisual heritage and was fully HTML5 based. The previous portal, which had innovative <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/2013/05/virtual-exhibitions-shortlisted-for-fiatiftas-archive-achievement-awards/\">virtual exhibition features</a> and provided the metadata of the videos <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/2011/09/television-archives-join-linked-open-data-movement/\">as linked data</a>, was built on Flash, a technology which has since become outdated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the&nbsp; request of the content partners in the network, we developed the player with an anti-download system. This innovation expanded on the standards set by <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/\">HTML5 </a>and <a href=\"https://github.com/Noterik\">W3C, and was freely available as open-source code.</a> In 2018 we made sure that the player would be embeddable on the Europeana collections website via oEmbed, improving the playout experience for the 25 broadcasters and audiovisual archives whose materials you can access via EUscreen.eu. But we wanted more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Engaging with audiovisual sources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The year is 2020. Media players are all around us and we expect them all to work flawlessly, no matter where content is served from or how old it is. We decided that for a media player to be used on a cultural heritage focused platform, engagement would be key. We held multiple sessions with users to explore how they would use video during research, in the classroom, or for personal use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Teachers want to be able to embed videos they encounter in course materials. Perhaps even provide some remarks on it, or provide a translation of a short piece that’s in a different language. You may want to create a playlist of materials to keep on watching all the wonders of 20th Century European history sources.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Interoperable, too?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we started the Europeana Media project, we wanted to build on strong, existing, modern technologies. One of those was the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a>, or IIIF for short. IIIF is a set of standards that provide your browser with information to better handle a multitude of source materials. Originally developed for museum or library images (scanned books, newspapers, or massive resolution photos of paintings, for example), the standard branched out into audiovisual&nbsp; territory in 2016. The development of the IIIF Presentation 3.0 API standard is expected to be finalised in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to provide advanced features such as annotations, subtitles, embedding and more on videos or audio, we use IIIF-manifests, which is a descriptive standard for presentation metadata (information required to generate a viewing experience). The IIIF-manifest contains information about the media, information on how it can be displayed, and links to other information associated with the item in the form of annotations (including subtitles). The manifests are generated by the Europeana APIs and this project shows them to be one of the earliest adopters and implementers of IIIFv3. Our developers committed improvements made to the&nbsp;IIIF AV Component (an implementation developed with funding from the British Library for its Universal Viewer) back to its code base.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What player, where?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Europeana, video and audio materials that are provided by content partners can now also be experienced in even higher resolution via this new player (<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/2051933/data_euscreenXL_EUS_EB001C7794C7B27B6BAA746AB17B6F23\">see an example</a>). As Europeana does not yet have user sign-in services, some of the features are not yet available. Our newly instated <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/audiovisual-playout-in-europeana\">Task Force on Media Playout in Europeana</a> will continue advocating for this development!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can experience the full feature set of the player on the <a href=\"http://euscreen.eu\">EUscreen portal</a>. When you go to our content partner Istituto LUCE’s video collection, and log in with your MyEUscreen account, you’ll be able to use all the features described above. See the video below for a handy walkthrough. We will be rolling out the new player’s features to all collections that grant their permission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re curious about the insides of the player, take a look at its code base over on the <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/media-player\">Europeana GitHub</a>.

        intro: "<p>While cultural tourism has been badly affected by the COVID-19 crisis, cultural heritage continues to act as inspiration for individuals across Europe to explore the continent’s history, sites and art. In this post, we introduce our ‘Discovering Europe’ season, which will highlight Europe’s rich natural beauty and cultural heritage to inspire travel to local and alternative destinations.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Cultural tourism represents 40% of tourism in Europe, making a significant contribution to the sector. The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on tourist activities has affected cultural tourism badly, with activities like fairs and festivals cancelled and institutions such as museums closed (93%, of museums\_closed globally according to <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/fileadmin/Dateien/public/NEMO_documents/NEMO_COVID19_Report_12.05.2020.pdf\">a recent NEMO report</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the opportunities for cultural heritage tourism have been reduced by COVID-19, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/creative-approaches-and-collaborations\">online initiatives sharing cultural heritage</a> have continued to offer inspiration to audiences across Europe. And, as the European Commission’s recently published strategy for recovery <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1591191111789&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0550\">‘Tourism and transport in 2020 and beyond’</a> highlights, the relaxation of some travel restrictions offers people the chance to explore and enjoy cultural heritage, within their own countries and within the bounds of safe travel.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this context and as highlighted in the strategy, today we are launching our ‘Discovering Europe’ season. Whether our audiences plan to stay close to home, visit new areas, or learn about unfamiliar places, our season will showcase cultural heritage to inspire travel plans to local and alternative destinations. Throughout the summer we will feature cultural jewels and hidden gems across the continent in galleries, blogs and learning scenarios which highlight the diversity and beauty that Europe offers. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/discovering-europe\">Explore them all on the Discovering Europe browse page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will also showcase projects, apps and initiatives from the sector and Europeana Network which highlight cultural heritage as inspirational to travel. A dedicated page on the Europeana Pro site will bring together information about the editorial for our season with relevant news related to cultural heritage tourism and of interest to cultural heritage professionals. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe\">Explore the page.</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/discovering-europe\">Discovering Europe</a>'\_season is one of a series of complementary European Commission related initiatives to promote cultural heritage in the context of tourism this summer.\_These will include the Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC)’s\_‘<em>Europe’s Culture Close to you</em>’, launching June 18, and promotion of the Joint Research Centre’s <a href=\"https://culturalgems.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">Cultural Gems </a>app from July.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage institutions can get involved by sharing their own collections which celebrate the beauty of Europe and local attractions online with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiscoveringEurope\">#DiscoveringEurope</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have seen examples of inspiring ways the cultural heritage sector is encouraging and supporting tourism locally? Or projects, resources and initiatives related to cultural tourism? We are looking to gather resources for cultural heritage tourism to share with our network - and more widely - so if you have an initiative that you think that we could profile, <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/34467373cc8c4e1a87e88b3f35faef00\">let us know.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19: preparation and action'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Throughout June, Europeana is bringing together 60 cultural heritage professionals from across Europe for a special series of peer-to-peer workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, one of the process’s facilitators, Michael Peter Edson, reflects on the second week of the workshops and discussions around the importance of preparation and the possibility of action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In the first two weeks of our ‘Digital Transformation in the time of COVID-19’ workshops, we’ve discussed a variety of topics. We’ve heard about dramatic changes in work-from-home culture; inspirational projects from inside and outside the cultural sector; and challenges and changes in organisational thinking\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first week alone I found over 40 different themes and sentiments running through our conversations, but one of the most profound observations to emerge so far has to do with the opportunity cost of this moment (the value of decisions made, and not made), and the need to begin change now, in whatever ‘now’ you’re in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The importance of preparation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week we asked participants to reflect on this question: 'what do you know now that you wished you had known when the crisis began?'\_Many told us that if they had known early on how long this crisis would last, and how profound its disruptive potential would be, they would have taken action much sooner to initiate change.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘We all knew about these things that we ought to have done,’ said one participant: others mentioned building a social media presence, forging relationships with audiences and collaborators, climate action, the digital divide, and building digital capacity across their whole organisations as work that was known to be important, but which never got done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘There were things we knew we had to address at some point, but we were all working on our regular tasks so we didn’t have time to do that,’ said another attendee.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And another added, ‘My organisation thought it was a digital organisation, but we didn’t realise how unprepared we were.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking through my notes from the workshops, despite moments of optimism about the positive responses that have come out of the GLAM sector, I sense a feeling of regret\_among our colleagues regarding the cultural sector’s level of preparedness heading into the crisis and our ability to have an impact during <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5f05b5c-7db8-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84\">The Great Shutdown</a> and the global protests that have followed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd\">killing of George Floyd</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I don’t want to be all gloomy here. There’s a big upside as well.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The possibility of action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another profound observation from the first two weeks of workshops has been an overwhelming sense that action seems possible now in ways that it never has before.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One participant told us of a senior curator who quickly created an online exhibition — the first for their museum — to connect with distant students and audiences when the museum closed.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard of admiration for small scale, often playful digital cultural initiatives and the fast, grass-roots mobilisation of local cultural and performing-arts institutions, creative artists, and libraries. Even the creativity and community-engagement shown by bookstores, bakeries, farmers, and other small businesses were found to be inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘We are refocusing and reframing our work around things that did not seem to be possible before. We have realised that [the old rules] were not cut into stone,’ declared one workshop attendee last week.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And many others spoke of colleagues, departments, and even entire organisations that were able to pick themselves up and get remarkable and previously unimaginable work done together in a very short amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I learned that [my colleagues] are more digitally savvy than I thought they would be. I was hesitant at first, we have a very traditional organisation, but it happened very quickly,’ said one participant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another added that he would have ‘pushed a lot harder’, even before the COVID-19 crisis, if he had known how readily his colleagues would embrace digital change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reflecting further\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These observations about opportunity cost, delay, and action are a lesson for all of us.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have our own lists of positive things we could be doing. We’ve been saying that GLAMs should use the Internet to create a better, more just, and more resilient society for as long as I’ve known what the Internet was, but day-to-day it’s easy to take a little more time to plan and consider things before we act.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, thinking is good, but in times like this we can begin to see the value of beginning digital transformation — beginning all kinds of transformation — before a crisis is at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or as the old saying goes: 'The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second-best time is now.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Share your thoughts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These workshops have opened up important conversations and we welcome your thoughts. Tell us, what do you know now that you wished you had known when the crisis began? And what kinds of new actions are important to you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please share your thoughts on Twitter with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildDigitalCapacity\">#BuildDigitalCapacity</a>.

                body: "<h3>New content and innovation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to delivering around&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=Fifties%20in%20Europe%20Kaleidoscope%20-%201950s\">18,000 hitherto unseen photographs of the 1950s to Europeana</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/fifties-in-europe-kaleidoscope\">Fifties in Europe Kaleidoscope project</a> made use of innovative approaches and tools to enhance audience experiences with Europeana content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We collected information and feedback about two tools which encourage interaction and engagement with digital photographic heritage collections: WithCrowd annotation tool and the Visual Similarity Search.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://withcrowd.eu/en;\">WithCrowd</a> allows people to collect annotations on content available through the Europeana collections website, and, after a process of curation and validation, uses these annotations to enrich Europeana records. The platform also hosts crowdsourcing campaigns through which contributors can add and validate semantic annotations in a user-friendly and engaging way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Visual Similarity Search tool uses advanced algorithm technology to recognise predefined themes and link images based on their visual resemblance. To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm in real world scenarios, the project developed a <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/kaleidoscope-project-exploring-algorithm-for-visual-similarity-search/\">test mobile application</a> as a demo, that allows users to submit a picture and retrieve a set of matching images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Blue Skies, Red Panic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Fifties in Europe Kaleidoscope project also organised an exhibition entitled Blue Skies, Red Panic. This showcase explores and documents the 1950s through images from the collections of project partners and Europeana. The exhibition was presented in a wide range of formats, from a <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/exhibitions/blue-skies-red-panic/\">physical setup</a> launched at the Museum of Graphics in Pisa and then shown across Europe, to an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/blue-skies-red-panic\">online exhibition</a> on the Europeana collections website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final iteration of Blue Skies, Red Panic made use of <a href=\"https://www.mupop.net/\">MuPop</a>, a digital exhibition tool that combines social interaction and digital showcases. It encouraged online dialogue between visitors to the exhibition, bridging the physical (an on-site screen) and digital (the virtual nature of the showcase).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blue Skies MuPop debuted at the <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/blue-skies-in-leuven/\">Day of Science at KU Leuven</a> and was used in other project’s events, also celebrating the successful conclusion to the project at its final conference in the Museum für Fotografie in Berlin (20-21 February 2020).&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

For example, the <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/kaleidoscope-workshop-on-family-photography-in-girona/\">Memories workshop in Girona entitled ‘Family Photo Talks’</a> used oral history as a methodology to generate and transmit knowledge. The <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/crowdsourcing-campaign-kaleidoscope/\">Crowdsourcing workshop in Athens</a> invited participants to contribute to the Kaleidoscope annotation WithCrowd campaigns focused on the themes of 1950s Style and Design and 1950s Transport and Travel. The <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/rephotography-coventry-photos-and-fun/\">Rephotography workshop in Coventry</a> focused on repeat photography as a way of engaging users with ‘then’ (1950s) and ‘now’.</p>\r\n"

Entitled, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/creating-a-digital-cultural-heritage-community\">‘Creating a digital cultural heritage community’,</a> the MOOC is hosted on the&nbsp;EdX platform and aims to create capacity in engaging audiences with cultural heritage through digital practices, discovering and engaging with the online collections available via Europeana. The course shows examples of photography and dance, which both have links to perception and memory and foster dialogue around cultural heritage. The images of the postwar period demonstrate how photographs both reflect reality as well as shape and influence it. The Kaleidoscope project also delivered a <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/colorful-culture-in-the-1950s-blue-skies-red-panic-ls-hr-215/\">Learning Scenario about life in the 1950s</a> for publication on the TeachwithEuropeana blog.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>We want people to be able to search for, find and use cultural heritage material online. That’s&nbsp;easier - and a much smoother experience for everyone - when the content files (the images, text documents or audio/video clips) and accompanying metadata (the information about what the item is and where it comes from) are of good quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the&nbsp;Europeana Strategy 2020-2025, we will continue to work with aggregators and data providers to invest in resources, activities and technologies - like machine-learning and other enrichment services - to make our metadata and content better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A focus on quality&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working through existing aggregators’ networks, and with the support of EU Member States, we’ll work on helping institutions to understand why good data is important and we’ll support them to produce higher quality content and metadata. We’ll develop and use the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> to support how institutions work with, produce and improve the material they share with us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll showcase high-quality content via Europeana’s editorial and campaigns, and we’ll develop the platform itself to put more emphasis on our partner institutions and make sure that good results are visible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cosmina Berta from the German Digital Library and a member of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee</a> says,&nbsp; ‘The biggest challenges for metadata practitioners are defining what data quality is and implementing data quality metrics, especially because data usage scenarios change over time. I hope through this strategy we can reach more of a consensus regarding defining and measuring data quality and define a clearer concept about its implementation. I am a big fan of standardisation and in my ideal world, standardisation will play a bigger role in defining and achieving data quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘If we define the goals we want to achieve - the ‘what’ and the ‘to what end’ – then the ‘how’ to get there can be more easily outlined, implemented and standardised. Aggregators are important here. Institutions can then better reach their audience and advance their overall research and education purposes.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Getting better connected</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When cultural content and metadata are prepared in a standardised way, no matter which institution creates them, they can be used in and across a wide range of systems, not just the Europeana platform. Cultural heritage institutions can benefit from, for example, interoperability with collections from other institutions or connections to international initiatives such as Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, the use of standard linked data formats coupled with improvements to multilingualism will lead to better connection of Europeana’s collections with other platforms and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henning Scholz, Europeana Foundation’s Partner and Operations Manager, says, ‘With the release of the Europeana Publishing Framework metadata component in summer 2019, we made multilingualism integral to our concept of data quality. Making it clear what language the metadata is provided in will facilitate machine translation of metadata, making our heritage accessible in all EU languages. We still have a long way to go, but if we can focus on tagging key metadata fields with the correct language, we can make good progress over the next two years.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Using tech - and people power - to enrich data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Manually improving the metadata quality of millions of records from different sources requires a huge amount of time and resources. The application of artificial intelligence tools and machine-learning, combined with human knowledge provided by both domain experts and crowd-sourcing campaigns (think <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enrich-europeana\">EnrichEuropeana</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crowd-heritage\">CrowdHeritage</a>), offers a remarkable opportunity for improving the quality of metadata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will work on ways to enrich metadata and perform data-related tasks automatically, semi-automatically or by using the strength of the crowd.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Cultural heritage institutions differ significantly, depending on the type of collections they manage, their domain, their funding, their relation to Europeana, and their experience with and openness towards technical innovation. Digital transformation is particularly challenging for small and medium institutions with limited internal skills and capacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the new strategy, the Europeana Initiative will support all institutions in their digital transformation. What does that mean? It means that we will showcase the importance and value of digitisation and the adoption of standards, best practice and common solutions in making quality content that is useful for a global online audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Training and skills for digital transformation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will be the place that cultural heritage professionals turn to for guidelines on topics such as digitisation, metadata enrichment, semantic interoperability, content creation,&nbsp;licensing, reuse, business models and innovation. They’ll find this information on our website Europeana Pro, through their membership of the Europeana Network Association (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">join now!</a>) or Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and through physical and digital events such as conferences, workshops and webinars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To build the skills and capacity that institutions and individuals need, we need to truly understand the needs of the cultural heritage sector. You can see this in action in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">phased project</a> to help us identify and shape a capacity-building framework for the sector. This project includes a series of peer-to-peer workshops being run throughout June 2020, in which 60 cultural heritage professionals discuss ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’.&nbsp;The outcomes of the workshops and an accompanying report from Culture24 will shape the next phase of this project as we&nbsp;involve more voices from across the sector and continent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workshop participants seek to prepare for a successful digital future by understanding the sector’s full potential and challenges. As Jasper Vissor, one of the workshop facilitators <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-exploring-the-immediate-impact\">writes</a>, ‘within the GLAM sector, different realities exist at the same moment. One organisation’s strength is another organisation’s challenge... Together, we will look to understand the complex dynamics of what enabled some GLAMs to face the crisis proactively while others struggle, and what success actually means and looks like for digital cultural heritage in a post-COVID-19 world.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Developing networks that support digital transformation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Three organisations make up the Europeana Initiative - the Europeana Foundation, the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregators' Forum. The new strategy will see both the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and the Europeana Network&nbsp;Association supported and structured so that they can raise awareness, build partnerships, enable peer-to-peer working and reach out to the research, education and creative sectors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia Fallon is the Manager of Europeana Foundation's Community and Partner Engagement Team. She says, 'Connecting to a strong professional network can be a game-changer, providing opportunities for growth, collaboration and&nbsp;inspiration, and help you&nbsp;find&nbsp;a home among&nbsp;like-minded professionals. Our Networks, Forum and Communities will evolve to provide tangible opportunities that support individual&nbsp;and organisational development. And they&nbsp;will provide&nbsp;a welcoming space for emerging professionals&nbsp;and those wanting to start a conversation with their peers on things that matter to them.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Strengthening national infrastructures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned right at the start of this post - all cultural heritage institutions are different. And one of the things that makes them so is that they work within not only the systems - and aspirations - of their own institution, but the processes and policies of their national infrastructures. Each country’s approach to culture, and to digital, is different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through this strategy, we will work with Member States to achieve greater harmony with national policies on digital culture, and we’ll work to correct the uneven distribution of national aggregators across Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make sure that all institutions are aware of the value of digital culture and that they have the support they need to invest resources in contributing their collections to Europeana. Finally, we want to appeal to all who believe in the transformative power of digital culture to act as ambassadors within their own countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19: collaboration for hard questions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Throughout June, Europeana has brought together 60 cultural heritage professionals from across Europe for a special series of peer-to-peer workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, one of the process’s facilitators, Jasper Visser, discusses the final workshops which took place in the series and two themes that stood out: asking ‘hard’ questions and the importance of collaboration.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Last week, we concluded Europeana’s online <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">sense-making workshops about digital transformation in the time of COVID-19</a>. Over three weeks, participants explored topics including digital cultural heritage, COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter. In the coming weeks, my fellow facilitator <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/michael-peter-edson\">Michael Peter Edson</a> and I will work on a report of the outcomes of this process, but this post explores two ideas that stood out to me in last week’s workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Asking hard questions\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early in the week, a participant mentioned that what the process offered, and what they appreciated, was the opportunity to engage with ‘hard questions’. More than once, participants joked that we, the facilitators, had a knack for asking these. For instance, the question of what it would take to make the working practices which have emerged over\_the past few months sustainable, or what we need as a sector to be successful in the future that is not already present in our networks. Given that the questions and prompts that participants were asked to respond to were updated throughout the process to reflect the conversations, many of these hard questions are actually ones participants asked themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve hinted at some of these questions in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/build-digital-capacity\">earlier posts</a>. They deal with a range of themes. From data security and open access to storytelling and leadership. From inclusion and diversity to collaboration and partnerships. All in all, we’ve discussed around four dozen themes in the workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult for anyone to have a resolute opinion on all these topics. Especially given, as one participant noted in a line that I will not soon forget, that a real expert knows there are different ways to look at something.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, others mentioned that GLAMs and cultural heritage professionals are susceptible to the ‘perfection trap.’ We would rather not speak up unless we’re confident we’re right. Which raises the question another participant posed: ‘How do we deal with topics that we are not an expert in?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the time of COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, climate change, and other urgent and transformative movements, this question is one of the hardest of all. And its answer may be evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Individually, we do not have to be experts in everything. Instead, collectively, we need to have access to all relevant expertise that we need in our current and future roles. This means we need to collaborate with each other, in our organisations, in our field and beyond it. Not surprisingly, throughout the workshops and the surveys, participants mentioned collaboration repeatedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a basic level, COVID-19 changed collaboration within organisations. Some hierarchies were restructured. Digital teams found renewed meaning in organisations where their expertise was in high demand. On a more strategic level, participants mentioned they were inspired by collaborations happening within the sector as a response to the crisis, as well as by partnerships beyond the confines of GLAMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaboration with each other was highlighted as a way forward for the sector. One participant challenged us to think of the (digital) GLAM sector as, ‘one big company.’ Like a multinational organisation, in this company, we already share infrastructure, resources, knowledge, and experiences and could do this more in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaboration, which is always a popular idea in workshops like this, may have renewed relevance in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, which has shown that within the cultural heritage sector there is solidarity and a willingness to support each other when we can. One participant observed that as cultural professionals, we are all humans and share many things, including problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Next steps\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming weeks, Michael Peter Edson and I will be writing up a report on these workshops, sharing and detailing the most influential and frequently mentioned themes. Our ambition is not to provide a definitive answer or direction for any of them, but to show the diversity of perspectives that exists. As a collective, it seems, we’re expert enough to know there are always different ways to look at something.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back on the last three months, what hard questions have you asked yourself? What ideas, concepts or words stand out to you as important for the (near) future of our sector? We’d love to hear about them! Please share your thoughts on Twitter with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildDigitalCapacity\">#BuildDigitalCapacity</a>. Feel free to tag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">@Europeanaeu</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpedson\">@mpedson</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaspervisser\">@jaspervisser</a> as well. Your insights and ideas will help us shape the conversations and outcomes of this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look out for an upcoming Pro news piece where we will share the outcomes of this report. You can also <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=70e7d06bec\">sign up to stay up to date with the project</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month, Pilar Irala-Hortal, Director of the Archivo Fotográfico Jalón Ángel, discusses her work in the archive and enthusiasm for bringing photographic heritage to wider audiences.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About Pilar</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I became the director of the <a href=\"https://jalonangel.com/\">Jalón Ángel Photographic Archive</a> after San Jorge University, where I am a professor and researcher, asked me to manage the donation of the collections kept by the photographer’s family. Ángel García de Jalón (1898-1976) was one of the most important portrait photographers in Spain between the 1920s and 1976. The donation of his collections was made in 2011 to the San Valero Foundation, one of the most important educational groups in Spain, to which the San Jorge University belongs. Upon receiving this donation the University commissioned me to enhance, implement and direct the newborn archive.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a degree in Art History and a PhD in the same field, and my thesis focused on photography at the end of the 20th century. I also have a master's degree in Cultural Heritage Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently I teach as a Senior Lecturer in Visual Culture, Photography and Contemporary Art, and also carry out research. I focus on the relationships between photography, rhetoric and visual narrative and on historical-photographic heritage. My last book <em>El Síndrome de Barthes. La construcción retórica de la imagen fotográfica</em> (<em>The Barthes Syndrome: The rhetorical construction of the photographic image</em>, ed. Fragua) was published in 2019.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my work at the Jalón Ángel Archive,\_ we are currently immersed in the annual call for our <a href=\"http://www.jalonangel.com/premio\">International Photography Award</a>, as well as the progress in the cataloging of our huge collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that my position has two big challenges. Firstly, to obtain funding to advance the cataloging and study of Jalón Ángel's work, as well as to improve and update our facilities and material resources. For this, we need a qualified staff, and with funding we have greater opportunities to train personnel for the Archive itself, or for research tasks. The second challenge involves bringing the work of Jalón Ángel to university students. We try to engage them through scholarships or photo contests on campus, but it is a hard task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite part of my work is, above all, uncovering a key figure in the history of photography. I also enjoy bringing the work of Jalón Ángel and the art of photography itself to thousands of photographers (professionals and amateurs) around the world through our Jalón Ángel International Photography Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</strong>\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was enthusiastic about being part of a proactive, international organisation which would allow me to contribute towards the advancement of the protection and conservation of European cultural heritage. In addition, I wanted to meet and be in contact with inspiring cultural heritage professionals from across Europe, to learn from them and their institutions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Member Councillor, I am especially interested in studying and creating mechanisms so that people with intellectual and, or sensory difficulties are guaranteed access to and enjoyment of cultural heritage. For this, it is necessary to design for access, digitisation, interpretation and dissemination which is suitable for all. In this sense, technology is a key element, but we are the people who must first define the actions and ways to make it happen.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Shaping the role of the Europeana Aggregators'' Forum within the Europeana Initiative'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>At its meeting in May 2020, the Europeana Aggregators'\_Forum approved various changes to its governance structure, agreed to set up its own task forces and working groups, and welcomed a closer alignment with the Europeana Network Association.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Thanks to a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">network of national, thematic and domain aggregators</a>, Europeana enables thousands of cultural heritage institutions to share their content and open it up to new audiences. The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) coordinates\_ the operational and strategic activities required for the effective functioning of this pan-European, cross-domain aggregation ecosystem. Explore some of the changes and initiatives the EAF recently agreed, below.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The original structure\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the EAF meeting in Berlin in 2018, members agreed a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/breathing-new-life-into-the-europeana-aggregators-forum\">light governance model for the EAF</a> and elected <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-rendina\">Marco Rendina</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> as chair and vice-chair, with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/henning-scholz\">Henning Scholz</a> the Europeana Foundation representative in charge of the EAF Secretariat. This model facilitated the successful organisation of EAF activities in its initial stages and collaboration between Europeana aggregators.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, over the past few months\_the EAF Steering Group has decided to revise the original EAF governance structure to strengthen and formalise its role, and to allow aggregators to establish initiatives that specifically address their needs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Role within the Europeana Initiative\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of 2020, the Europeana Initiative has aimed to align the objectives and activities of the EAF with those of the Europeana Foundation and the Europeana Network Association (ENA). Collaborating more closely, these three interlinked expert organisations can make strategic decisions to achieve common goals and work together towards the overall strengthening of the Europeana Initiative. This includes aligning Europeana’s activities in projects, communities, task forces, and standardising procedures for training across the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Changes to the Steering Group</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to start moving toward these goals, at its meeting in May 2020, the EAF Steering Group proposed various changes to the governance of the EAF and how it works with the ENA. It also approved the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Aggregation/EAF-Activity-Plan-2020.pdf\">EAF 2020 Activity Plan</a>, which was presented to the Forum.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Forum approved having a third aggregator representative in the Steering Group and elected <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kerstin-herlt\">Kerstin Herlt</a> from Deutsches Filminstitut &amp; Filmmuseum to fill this role. Furthermore, the EAF approved aligning the duration of the electoral term for EAF Steering Group members with that used by the ENA, increasing it from two to three years, and allowing the members to run for a maximum of two terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Closer alignment with the ENA</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To better align EAF and ENA activities, and facilitate communication between the EAF and the ENA Management Board and Members Council, the Network and Policy Officer in charge of the ENA Secretariat, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/zuzana-malicherova\">Zuzana Malicherova</a>, joined the EAF Secretariat. The EAF Secretariat will ensure the closer coordination and collaboration of EAF and ENA activities, based on their common interests. This collaboration will be\_ reflected in the work of the communities, task forces, and working groups, as well as EAF and ENA communications efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>EAF Task Forces and Working Groups</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Forum also approved setting up a number of task forces and working groups that will function under the EAF. The first EAF <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/iiif-europeana-working-group\">working group on IIIF adoption, training, and translation of resources</a> began in May in collaboration with the ENA. Further EAF task force activities starting in 2020 aim to focus on advocacy efforts, and developing and formalising the ‘train the trainer’ concept to establish efficiently structured training workshops.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To share more information about the EAF, we are introducing a dedicated section of news for aggregators to our monthly network newsletter - ENA members can look out for this in their next update!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not yet an ENA member and would like to receive this newsletter, you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up today</a> - it is free and simple to join, offers many benefits. Also keep an eye on Europeana Pro news for future posts!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Shaping priorities for the future</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission is evaluating one of its main policy instruments on digitisation, online access and digital preservation of cultural heritage material. The current policy recommendation was developed in 2011 and helps ministries of culture in each of the EU Member States to set their priorities and directions on digital cultural heritage, and support the work done by cultural heritage institutions across Europe. It has resulted in support for Europeana’s development as a European platform for digital culture through the millions of digitised items made available from across all Member States. The Commission is asking for your opinion on what the priorities and directions should be for the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent COVID-19 crisis has highlighted more than ever the importance of online access to digital cultural heritage. It has also shown the resilience, creativity and solidarity of our sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our sector has a valuable contribution to make to Europe’s recovery in a post-crisis world, with digital culture playing a key role.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Digital transformation has never been so important</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have an opportunity to build on the momentum and recognition sparked by the crisis to help shape our sector’s digital future. We can shape the future to meet our needs and ambitions, and&nbsp;strengthen our contribution to society. But only if we work collaboratively and speak with a strong, shared voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Raising our voice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next few months are critical.&nbsp; This consultation comes as decisions are being made at national and EU level on the future impact of Europe’s cultural heritage sector and the funding available to support it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to help shape those decisions. Raising your voice in this consultation, as a professional and/or as an organisation is vital.&nbsp;You can read the joint repsonse of the Europeana&nbsp;Foundation, Europeana Network Association and Europeana&nbsp;Aggregators Forum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-initiative-position-consultation-on-opportunities-offered-by-digital-technologies\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission wants to hear your views. We urge you to respond to their consultation survey before 14 September and make sure that the voice of the cultural heritage sector is heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Responding to the survey</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Go to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-opportunities-offered-digital-technologies-culture-heritage-sector\">consultation</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You will need to create an account if you do not already have one, and then login.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We urge you to complete the survey as fully as you can. It asks for your views on the importance of access to digital culture, of Europeana’s role in that, and what support you feel is required to make the advances needed as&nbsp;an institution and as a sector. Questions covered include the need for high-quality digitisation, skills-building and the use of 3D and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Question 24: &nbsp;The EU’s funding of Europeana is important.

Questions 26 and 29 include specific references to Europeana.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You also have the opportunity (Question 30) to provide further thoughts on improving digitisation, online access, digital preservation and digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector, and to submit position papers (Question 31).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to consider issues such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">democratising access to cultural heritage in ways that support inclusivity, creativity and critical engagement in education and knowledge-sharing</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the importance of collaborations that strengthen the sustainability and innovation capacity of the sector&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">how promoting the use of digital technology and expertise to ensure our shared cultural heritage remains authentic, trustworthy and traceable is vital as people increasingly seek reliable sources of online information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Prioritise culture!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Change doesn’t just happen. It requires individuals, organisations, countries, and indeed the European Commission to share the same priorities. To allocate resources. To be committed.

        featured: false
        intro: "<p>When large parts of Europe went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, events had to start to work very differently. Physical meetings went digital. Face-to-face discussions became screen-to-screen. The focus of conversations changed. In this post, Gina van der Linden reflects on this shift from physical to digital events, and shares her learnings from the past few months.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Adjusting to the new normal</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the world, the COVID-19 crisis has catalysed huge changes in our personal and working lives. For many people, the past few months have been intense and most of us are all still adapting to this ‘new normal’.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Europeana Foundation, our work environment changed as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-working-with-you-in-the-time-of-coronavirus\">staff began to work from home</a>. Some might assume that, working for an organisation with a focus on digital, this meant that we simply moved our ‘desk’ from our office to our own homes. This was true for some, but posed a challenge for others, including me as Events Manager.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until this year, our focus had been on organising physical events such as our annual conference. Personally, this was and is my passion. But 2020 has already proven to be very different. At the beginning of March we realised - like many institutions around the world - that we had to switch from physical to virtual meetings. As we worked to organise these, exchanging information with our peers across our network and sector was hugely valuable. Below, I share some of Europeana’s own learnings about this process.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>First steps: trialling the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana we decided to move entirely from in-person events to online events for the rest of this year. That was of course easier said than done. We needed to rethink our way of working and move quickly to bring our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> meeting and a following Copyright Workshop online within a few weeks.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a team we worked intensively to create an ‘online-proof’ programme.\_ We ran tests, became familiar with new tools, and created clear roles and responsibilities for the team. We also designed <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Aggregator_Forum/Europeana-Aggregator-Forum-Spring-2020.pdf\">an online programme and a workbook</a> so people could find everything they needed in one place, and in advance of the events. We had already learned that having even a few online meetings in one day can be exhausting, so we wanted to make this as easy and as accessible as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the talks and workshops themselves, we decided to ‘flip the classroom.’ Instead of having live online presentations, we asked all speakers to record their presentation at home so that we could share those in advance with our participants to watch at their own convenience. In the programme, a dedicated time slot related to these videos was reserved for discussion and some Q&amp;A.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We added as much detailed information to the workbook as possible so people would know in advance what to expect and could prepare themselves. We also shared a Google document beforehand so people could add any comments, thoughts or questions before the meeting.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>70 people attended the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and Copyright Workshop, most joining both days from start to finish. According to the positive feedback we received from participants in the days afterwards, it was a real success!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course not everything went smoothly, and we learned a lot during those sessions. For example we realised that we needed to create a flowchart with key rules and guidelines to run digital events - not only to make our lives easier, but to also benefit our network. This chart is being designed as we speak and will be available soon with some useful tips and tricks.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get involved and learn more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have organised a variety of online events since the Aggregators’ Forum, and are continually building on our learning. In the coming months we have planned more exciting webinars and workshops, which are all <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">listed on Europeana Pro</a>. We will also be publishing more posts sharing knowledge and learning around online events, so check Europeana Pro news for more!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Communicators Community</a>, with the Europeana Foundation, is holding a webinar on Tuesday 7 July on ‘Running webinars: what we’ve learnt so far’ to share learning and facilitate discussion about holding events online - you can<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/running-webinars-what-we-ve-learnt-so-far\"> sign up for the webinar today.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course we hope to welcome you at our online annual conference in November. We are working on a programme for this, but please <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">save the date, 11-13 November\_and register your interest</a> so you will receive news first hand.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>As part of our ‘Discovering Europe’ season, we explore initiatives from across the cultural heritage sector that support and highlight cultural tourism locally and further afield. In this post, we interview Marion Ratier, Communications and Cultural Project Coordinator at European Historic Houses. She discusses the online initiatives her association organised during closures caused by COVID-19, and the ongoing relevance of these projects even as some houses begin to reopen.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us about the European Historic Houses (EHH).\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeanhistorichouses.eu/\">EHH</a> is an independent, non-profit organisation representing 50,000 private owners of historic buildings, their gardens and parks throughout Europe. Our principal objective is to secure, at the European level, favourable measures for the conservation and the sustainable development of private historic houses.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the members you represent?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The main part of these owners’ incomes comes from visits to their houses and the events they organise in them, and spring and summer are their main income periods. The private heritage sector was very much impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you support them in sharing their houses and collections with the public when the crisis prevented visitors?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to people’s desire to explore Europe virtually during this period, we decided to make the third edition of our European Heritage Weeks an online project. This initiative began in 2018, when to celebrate the European Year of Cultural Heritage, European Historic Houses organised ‘European Private Heritage Week’ (now called European Heritage Weeks). It brought together 642 houses, who open their doors to half a million visitors in\_ 17 countries under the motto ‘Our House, Your Heritage’. We then organised a second edition in 2019 which, again, was a great success!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To bring this initiative online, we were inspired by <a href=\"https://www.micastillodearena.es/?lang=en\">Mi Castillo de Arena</a>, a member of one of our Spanish associations, Casas Historicas y Singulares de Espana. They created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXmlw78DccI\">virtual journey</a> across Europe through online guided tours of privately-owned historic buildings on their Instagram Live. They contacted us to involve our network, and after the success of this first event, we agreed that EHH could take the project further.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you approach sharing the houses online?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We switched from Instagram to Facebook to ensure a wider audience, and organised a number of live, virtual tours of historic houses. We arranged four ‘rounds’ of visits at regular times over several weeks, presenting three houses in three different countries each time, in videos lasting about 15 minutes. We gathered an international audience and the first round of videos had a peak of 253 viewers during the live - which is quite a significant number for the small organisation we are! The 12 participants (owners and/ or managers of the houses) also very much enjoyed the experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12 videos are still available on our Facebook page and people continue to watch them. By\_ 24 June, our videos had been watched 72,300 times and this number is increasing every day! Encouragingly, some of the participants - as well as other owners who watched the videos - were inspired by this and organised virtual similar events outside of our project. \_<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/EuropeanHistoricHouses/677367679514623/\">Watch the Facebook lives.</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What challenges did you face?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our main issues were technological. Some of our owners didn’t have the necessary IT skills to manage a Facebook Live, which put us in the role of basic IT teachers in addition to roles as leaders and co-ordinators.\_ And most of these buildings are located in the countryside and they often do not have access to a good broadband connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What did you learn from your online experience and how do you plan to incorporate this new knowledge into future activities?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We realised that people from all around the world want to know more about European private historic houses and their owners, including the work needed to maintain these buildings, their history, and the challenges owners face. To share this information, we are now willing to be more active online and to work closely with our members - the national associations of private historic houses - and their members, to make their private heritage accessible as widely as possible.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now working on a new virtual project - most likely lasting from September to December 2020 - in which we will introduce two houses per month, linked to themes such as gardens, local production, restoration works and European history. Inspired by our experience in 2020, the fourth edition of our European Heritage Weeks in 2021 will be inaugurated by a live guided tour of one, or several, historic house(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How are your members preparing to reopen to the public as travel restrictions relax in some countries throughout Europe?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many have reopened, following their national restrictions. Some had reopened for locals as soon as the lockdown was lifted in their countries, and before travel restrictions started to be relaxed.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve heard from our members that a lot of people mention the Facebook Live Visits when visiting their houses, so, hopefully, we had an impact on the number of people who will visit European private historic houses this summer, and encouraged people to visit local cultural treasures!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The work is led by Franc J. Zakrajsek, a developer at&nbsp;LUNIDA, a partner and content provider of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-archaeology\">Europeana Archaeology project.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project re-used and enriched Europeana metadata. Additionally, cultural institutions from Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries digitised analogue objects and made them available through the repository. The project now presents movable, immovable, and intangible Art Nouveau heritage from the whole Danube region, including 3D models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19: edge predictions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana’s June workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’ are complete, and the topics and questions they highlighted have ongoing relevance for the cultural heritage sector. In this post, Michael Peter Edson explores the ‘edge predictions’ that workshop participants imagined as the possible futures for digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>What are we learning from the COVID-19 crisis, and what do these lessons tell us about where we need to go — individually, professionally, and as a sector — in the days, months, and years ahead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those were the big questions behind Europeana’s ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19 workshops’ which concluded at the end of June. Over the course of the three-week sense-making process, Jasper Visser and I took 61 members of the Europeana community on a journey through a landscape of ideas about working, thinking, creating, and doing good in the midst of a global pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked participants about changes in the content they create, the tools they use, and the way they collaborate. We asked about what inspired them, troubled them, and what they have learned and seen others learn as well. And we asked them to reflect on the meaning of ‘digital transformation’ and whether we have the right tools, knowledge and values, as a sector, to be truly relevant to the people we serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll report on the broad landscape of their reflections in the coming weeks, but looking back on it, one of the most significant questions we asked was about the edges of what these 61 digital cultural professionals might expect to see in their future work. In the final week of the workshops we asked:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Please make an edge prediction for our sector for the year 2025. An edge prediction is a prediction of something that <strong>might, but won’t necessarily</strong>, come true.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a summary of many comments from the participants themselves (edited lightly for continuity and to obscure the identity of the speakers), this is what we heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Edge scenario 1. Audiences, social engagement, and societal outcomes are paramount</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2025, the GLAM community is diverse, inclusive, and empowering. The sector has realised how important it is to communicate and engage with audiences and include new stories and narratives. GLAMs are more active in taking a stance in societal debates and the public is trusted with interpretation and input of content. Topics such as fighting fake news, racism, male dominance, inequality, supporting climate action and addressing other arising issues are better incorporated in GLAM’s mission and action than in 2020.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Edge Scenario 2. A two-speed GLAM sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2025, there is a ‘two speed GLAM sector’ divided between 'traditional' institutions that focus on being neutral, physical-centric, venerable, hierarchical; and 'radical' institutions that are agents of change, digital-centric, controversial, and community-oriented. Those that are thriving are more agile, quick, digital, user-centred, market-oriented, and financially sound.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Edge scenario 3: Stagnation and failure</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2025, the GLAM sector struggles to remain relevant and has lost its autonomy, leading to stagnation. Large parts of the GLAM sector are still struggling with fragile business models and recovering from substantial losses of funding in the\_political aftermath of the pandemic crisis. The sector is not dynamic — it is in decline and has become less and less influential. Governments and policymakers do not recognise culture’s benefits to social health, wellbeing, and the economy.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Edge scenario 4. Digital and physical are united as one</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2025, the GLAM sector has blended the digital and the physical aspects of their service. The sector is in perfect harmony with online and physical presence and shares efforts on both fronts. Digital engagement has equal status as on site experiences and content and digital visitors are as important as onsite visitors and are treated like that.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Edge scenario 5. GLAMs leading the digital revolution\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2025, the GLAM sector is known as one of the leaders in the digital revolution. Technically simple but timely and well communicated initiatives rise up next to AI, VR, and blockchain platforms to address new social circumstances. Digitisation workflows are efficient and well funded. GLAMs are so successful they have no need for financial profit: cooperation rather than competition in the digital field has led to a large communal infrastructure for arts and heritage that is an inspiration for other sectors.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Further reflections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few months ago, in normal times, creating and thinking about these edge scenarios may have seemed like a trivial activity — just looking at blurry photographs from a distant landscape that had little to do with the real world. But these aren't normal times, and if the sense-making of the last few weeks is any indication, futures that once seemed impossible are now a part of our daily lives and many of the edge scenarios described by our colleagues are already partly true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s the way the future usually arrives: not wholesale and from far away but piece-by-piece and now. And if that is true, and if all of the other inputs, insights, themes, observations, comments, and quirky one-off statements that we heard about over the last three weeks are any indication, the next question will have to be: what are we going to do about it? And when do we start?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share your thoughts on Twitter with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildDigitalCapacity\">#BuildDigitalCapacity</a>.

We organised a series of four webinars focussing on the theme ‘Culture from home’ and through them built new kinds of bridges across the community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was something very democratising about bringing together professionals who normally worked in a museum, library, archive or school and were kind enough to open up their homes and to share solutions for staying connected with their audiences.&nbsp; Everyone had amazing experiences to share and the conversation often felt almost electric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we asked the Steering Group for their highlights of the series, our Chair Peter Soemers said, 'The presenting institutions and their staff showed a very strong will to serve the needs of people, immediately, and as broadly as possible. Hear Louisa Torres repeating six times '<a href=\"https://youtu.be/c10J-9cANuc?t=1191\">to be useful</a>' and Andrew Payne talking about '<a href=\"https://youtu.be/IpaJnXTaA2k?t=595\">Giving it a go, taking a risk</a>.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Co-chair Killian Downing said, 'One of my favourite moments was playing with and sharing the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17874920485669850/\">Gallica BnF cat filters</a> highlighted by Marion Ansel and Louisa Torres to friends on Instagram.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Marianna Marcucci described the series as, 'An incredible journey through museums, archives and libraries. People from every part of Europe together sharing their experiences to empower and inspire each other. Awesome!'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Welcoming a global audience</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We recorded this series and you are invited to watch and share the four webinars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>But perhaps the most compelling moments occurred once we announced that we were turning off the recording and inviting everyone to join in.&nbsp; The Tana Libera Tutti (Free for all) part of the webinar became the moment when the audience became visible and actively joined in the conversation. Prior to that moment, the conversation took place in the chat where we were delighted to welcome participants from all over the world. Reading through our surveys at the end of the series we realised how important these discussions had been for participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to share with you some of their comments…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Thank you very much for organising these webinars. They are a great way to keep in touch with the sector and to continue to shape thinking around digital engagement, while many of us still aren't allowed to return to our roles.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Thank you all for your efforts in organisation of the webinar and for the possibility to meet such interesting people.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Thank you for bringing us together.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentiments echoed in the highlights experienced by our Steering Group. Cristina Roiu said that 'I liked most of all the feeling that ‘together we are stronger' and we are able to better overcome the obstacles and challenges we all face.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And our community manager Beth Daley, said, 'For some participants, this was the first time they'd had the opportunity to talk to colleagues from across Europe.

        intro: "<p>When large parts of Europe went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Europeana events team and the Europeana Network Association’s specialist communities had to start to work very differently. Big physical events went digital. Face-to-face discussions became screen-to-screen. The focus of conversations changed. The need to connect to other people was more important than ever.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana Network Association communities developed their own webinars. For example, Europeana Communicators’ series of\_ ‘Culture From Home’ webinars looked at how cultural institutions were turning online to connect with their audiences. Europeana Education delivered several webinars in conjunction with their partners and Europeana Copyright ran webinars on ‘Copyright and OpenGLAM’. The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum - usually a two-day in-person event - went entirely virtual this year. And our ‘Europe Day’ webinar was attended by around 500 people.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Community and Partner Engagement team coordinates these events to make sure they benefit the communities and the sector at large, that the programme of events is consistent and coherent and that individual events are well-managed. To support professionals in the sector, and share our learnings, we developed a guide to organising online events, which you can download and use below. It was designed so that we have a set of useful and usable guidelines for digital events organised by Europeana or organised in cooperation with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, we were also pleased to create an online version of this events guide - explore our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/events-toolkit\">Events toolkit</a>. You can also explore our webinar: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/running-webinars-what-we-ve-learnt-so-far\">Running webinars - what we've learnt so far.</a></p>\r\n"

This means you need to look at the event from the perspective of a speaker, a colleague, an organiser and a participant!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<strong>Your team</strong>: Build a team and make sure you choose people who own the skills you need to organise an amazing event. Respect each other, listen and have as many meetings as needed to build trust which in the end will result in a strong and solid team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<strong>Format and tool</strong>: Not all online meetings are the same or share the same goal. Pick a format and a tool that fits your needs best. Most important here are the amount of people you expect and how interactive you want your meeting to be. Our <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUgFGVgnqipJCpf7dWqjot3TRxfJVus_/view\">flowchart</a> may come in handy when making this decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<strong>Communication</strong>: Put your event out there! If people aren’t aware what you are organising they won’t be able to attend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;Don't be scared to make a mistake, we are human, that's just what we do once in while - and you can hear more about our mistakes in...</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Running webinars: what we’ve learnt so far</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this webinar, moderated by Europeana Communicators co-chair Susan Hazan, we talked to some of the people behind the online events that Europeana and the ENA communities have led in the past few months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panel discussed how to encourage people to interact in a webinar, how to measure the impact of digital events and what problems we’ve encountered so far - and how to deal with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Going to keep raving about that webinar. Used QR codes to share materials and an interactive questionnaire that was really impressive. I highly recommend it to anyone who finds themself needing to teach or run a meeting online. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/europeanacommunities?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#europeanacommunities</a></p>\r\n— Cinnamon Stephens (@Artantiq) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Artantiq/status/1280489377215455232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />At Europeana we’re now reflecting on the process, and a very rich report by workshop facilitators Michael Peter Edson and Jasper Visser that gathers together the main themes from the workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set up the ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’ workshops to bring people together to talk, in a structured way, during the turmoil of the COVID-19 crisis. 64 participants from 22 countries came together to identify opportunities for growth and positive action whilst also shedding light on Europeana’s strategic mission to ‘empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But COVID-19 wasn’t the only crisis the workshops addressed. Our sector is operating in a context of perpetual change and ‘COVID-19 was merely one of many changes that influenced a sector already going through considerable changes for decades. Soon, Black Lives Matters overtook COVID-19 as the main topic of conversation.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the summer, we’ll be discussing how the findings feed into our approaches to support the cultural heritage sector through its current challenges. We’ll share the report in full later this summer but here we share a first look at some of the key themes that have emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Desiring and delivering change are two different things</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops process showed that now is a moment of change and that action is required.&nbsp; ‘Change is a process where we cannot just be witnesses,’ said one participant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change that participants want to see includes a response to a lack of diversity in the sector which, once addressed, they felt would help them to tell a convincing story about the relevance of cultural heritage institutions to society:&nbsp;‘Participants share a sense of urgency and enthusiasm for a decisive change in the GLAM-sector to respond to long-simmering developments within the realm of social justice, health and wellbeing, the environment, and economic development.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, although our workshop participants are expert practitioners within their professional disciplines they do not all feel empowered to bring about that change within their own organisations. We need to reflect on this and consider how change can be delivered. For example, do we need to support professional development so that more of our Network members are empowered to act as agents of change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Empowerment to deliver change can be supported by moves towards uniting the sector, for example by developing an articulation of its core values and goals and an agreement on what digital transformation means for the sector. As one participant commented, ‘Are the values we have shared values or values in our little bubble?’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nBridging digital divides to work together on big ideas</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions showed a consensus that digital had taken&nbsp;centre stage in the cultural heritage sector during the first months of the pandemic. But now, the sector needs evidence of the ‘strategic impact of digital, the sustainability of digital business models, and the creative potential of further digitisation of cultural heritage’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants identified three types of divide to overcome to make sure digital can remain centre stage: ‘First, a social and technological divide between people who have access to and feel welcomed by digital cultural heritage and those who don’t. Then, an inter-organisational divide between GLAMs that are digitised and connected and those who are not. Thirdly, they recognise an intra-organisational divide between colleagues who are digitally-savvy and literate and those who are not.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants expressed a desire for their organisations to be updated to be effective and sustainable - to work in a truly digital way, rather than, as one participant said, ‘working in an analog way with digital tools’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was suggestion of a need&nbsp;for personal professional development, for knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours that include ‘soft skills’ alongside technical capability. Digital working isn’t just about tech, it’s about ‘people, interactions and social value’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that theme of interaction, participants commented regularly that they want their organisations to be involved in more collaboration, to be more creative and to take more risks. The report stresses that ‘To create a resilient and successful cultural sector, not one that stagnates and falls back into the past, we need to create space for innovation and experiments; learn from each other’s failures and successes; and allow for playful and creative engagement with the big ideas that will define the future.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What happens next&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within the Europeana Initiative, we’ll be talking a lot about the responses gathered in these workshops and how best to make use of them. We also look forward to the results of a forthcoming <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-digital-transformation-across-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">Culture24 report</a> to develop an understanding of what is happening in our sector to support digital capacity and what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions. So look out for more thoughts, including personal accounts from workshop participants, on Europeana Pro News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking a little further ahead, we hope that November’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2020 conference</a>&nbsp;will reflect new directions and processes influenced by the processes we’ve been through since March.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What can you do now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/g3lgpL\">our short form</a> to ensure you are the first to hear when we publish the report and about other opportunities to contribute to the project, and share your thoughts with us and others using the hashtag #BuildDigitalCapacity.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Foundation restructures its governance'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Foundation is an independently governed, non-profit organisation that operates the Europeana platform. To ensure its operations continue to run smoothly and efficiently and to better support the cultural heritage sector and reflect its diversity, the Foundation is changing its governance structure and inviting applications for board members for this new structure.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The governance model for the Europeana Foundation, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and employs around 60 staff, is changing. The organisation is currently steered by a Governing Board of 20 experts from cultural and scientific heritage organisations across Europe. The new structure will see the cultural heritage sector in all its diversity better represented, creating a stronger two-way link between the Foundation and the sector. This will put the Foundation in a better position to be able to support the cultural heritage sector and its audiences, and to build capacity for digital transformation and the benefits that brings to both institutions and their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change in governance will see the current governing board become a board of directors and a supervisory board, complemented and supported by a diverse and inclusive advisory board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The board of directors supported by a supervisory board will oversee the Foundation’s operations, while the advisory board will provide expert insight and extend the knowledge and strategic thinking of the board as a whole. The advisory board will act as the voice of the sector - expressing its interests, needs, challenges and best practices - and create links and connections back to the sector from the Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new model will ensure effective and efficient management of the Foundation’s operations, with inclusive and diverse representation from the cultural heritage sector and its audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Places on both the supervisory and advisory boards will be open for applications shortly. If you are interested in using your expert experience and insight to support Europeana and the cultural heritage sector, then keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaeu\">Twitter,</a> <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/3201557\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/jobs\">Careers page</a> for more information.

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month, Hans van der Linden discusses taking a holistic approach to digital transformation, and his work as a Policy Advisor at the Flemish Government Department of Culture, Youth and Media.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduating from modern history and library and information sciences I sailed the muddy waters of the temporary job market for a while, and then applied for a position at the Flemish Government in order to stimulate policymaking on digital cultural heritage. It was an inspiring time in which the need to address digital issues related to cultural heritage collections and audience interaction started to slowly arise.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on? \_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of 2017 the Flemish Government approved a vision note on a cultural policy in the digital era. This document proved to be a good starting point, but in order to achieve action,\_we need to focus on the digital transformation of the cultural sector as a holistic concept. All processes are important; an organisation is not an isolated entity but is part of an ecosystem. Institutions relate to and share processes with other institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, we are about to start a project which will lead to an overall strategy that sets clear goals for a cultural ecosystem: what do we want to achieve and how should it be organised? What about roles, relations and governance within that ecosystem? In September <a href=\"https://digitaleleiders.be/\">an extensive course on digital leadership</a> kicks off where the participants need to assess their own organisation and can ‘graduate’ through proof of concepts to implementations in their working context.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides that, we launched <a href=\"https://www.vlaanderen.be/cjm/cjm/cjm/nl/cultuur/digitale-cultuur/visie-en-beleid\">an initiative</a> to come up with a set of measures to stimulate digital transformation in the cultural sector, and put in place <a href=\"https://www.vlaanderen.be/cjm/cjm/cjm/nl/cultuur/digitale-cultuur/residenties-digitale-cultuur\">a small international network of digital residencies</a> for artists and cultural heritage professionals to work on digital cultural projects. And last but not least, the Flemish Government is co-organising a two day event\_<a href=\"https://mediafastforward.be/en/\">Media Culture Fast Forward</a> as an inspiring meeting place for cultural institutions, innovation and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The main challenge is to agree upon the nature of digital transformation. During the COVID-19 era, cultural institutions have increasingly focused on the digital issue in order to stay connected with their audiences but somehow this has shown that the digital ‘object’ is not to be seen as a substitute for physical activities. The potential of digital is on another level and it requires a new balance between the physical and digital spheres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the SAMR-model points out, we still are at the beginning of an evolution that should lead to rethinking culture and cultural activities. SAMR stands for\_Substitution -\_Augmentation - Modification - Redefinition,\_and describes the phases that changes encounter. During the last few years we have overcome the notion of digital as a threat for physical activities but we still have a long way to go. We need space for experimentation so that digital can become a vital part of cultural practices. This involves rethinking of business models.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An essential part of digital strategy is thinking in terms of ecosystems and interrelated processes between different kinds of institutions. The international playing field is important in this too and the Europeana network can help shape this landscape. It is important to define which processes benefit from being taken up on a European level. By joining the Members Council I believe I can have an impact on this.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, I took part in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">digital transformation workshops</a> organised by Europeana in June 2020, and enjoyed that experience. By both having attendees send in their thoughts beforehand and giving them the floor in the sessions, people were able to reflect thoroughly on the impact of the changing world on their work situation and were encouraged to detect elements of positive disruption.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By being an active part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> movement, I want to stress the importance of a holistic approach to the digital (also in relation with the physical) and the need to rethink concepts in order to maximise the importance of culture in a changing society.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Europeana Generic Services project Culture Chatbot aimed to help cultural heritage institutions to use chatbots to engage visitors, help them find content and answer common questions. Find out more about what the project achieved and the different chatbots it developed.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Chatbots and cultural heritage institutions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chatbots are pieces of software designed to react to digital conversations as if they were a human conversational partner. They are widely used across social media and commercial platforms. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/culture-chatbot\">Culture Chatbot Generic Services project</a> explored various needs and use-cases of museums and aggregators for which chatbots could be valuable.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, we developed a chatbot platform and several different versions of chatbots, each one addressing a set of needs of a partner. Eventually, the project delivered the following chatbots and technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Chatbot for Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This chatbot is integrated into the website of the museum. It was trained to maintain a simple conversation, to introduce museum exhibitions and collections, help people search for collection items and act as a ‘reading assistant’ by searching for keywords selected by those using online collections. It was trained to recognise entities from the dataset describing its museum collection. <a href=\"http://chatbot.jck.nl/\">Try out the chatbot</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Chatbot for the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This Facebook bot introduces the museum, including its permanent and temporary exhibitions, collections, campaigns, events and other subjects. It also allows people to search through the collections the museum shares with Europeana. The bot is in production and not yet deployed, but you can read more about it <a href=\"https://www.polin.pl/en/culture-chatbot\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Assisted Search Technology for CulturaItalia Portal</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Italian national aggregator, CulturaItalia, we could not find a natural use case to use the chatbot as it existed. They were interested in the national language-based search technology developed for the search function of the bot, and in and using the recent advances in machine learning for natural language processing and understanding. We worked to produce a better search function for the portal, which we called Assisted Search as it assists the user by understanding semantic entities in the query (people, places, works) and giving more weight to records containing these entities. You can play with the result on <a href=\"http://www.culturaitalia.it/opencms/index.jsp?language=en\">CulturaItalia portal</a> (note the 'Assisted Search' option).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana Multilingual Chatbot</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This standalone chatbot helps users navigate the collections of Europeana, allowing people to easily explore a rich variety of cultural heritage content, including several Europeana online exhibitions.<b>\_</b>Users can talk with the chatbot and ask queries that they would put into the Europeana search box. In addition, the bot speaks five European languages and translates the metadata of the found records to the language you choose. <a href=\"https://culturebot.eu/\">Try it out</a><b><a href=\"https://culturebot.eu/\">.</a>\_</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also see a chatbot on Europeana Pro, where it has been incorporated to help data partners to find an aggregator. Aggregators serve as a bridge between Europeana and cultural heritage institutions by gathering data and making it accessible through Europeana. Now, partners can chat and interact with the Culture Chatbot on Pro to determine which one they need to contact and get advice on sharing data. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Try out the chatbot</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This project was an amazing opportunity to explore the potential of this exciting technology for cultural heritage organisations. But even as we have delivered several different implementations, there are many more possibilities to explore. The platform will be developed further and we are interested in exploring new uses for it with aggregators and institutions in the Europeana network.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please <a href=\"mailto:info@jhn.ngo\">get in contact</a>\_if you'd like to try this technology in your institution and with your data, or <a href=\"http://jhn.ngo/culturebot/\">visit our website</a> to find out more.\_</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In a short report which brings together findings from research and conversations conducted in the past months, we have outlined our understanding of the main challenges that the cultural heritage sector deals with in relation to copyright. This has helped us define some steps for Europeana to work with its data partners, and help them overcome these challenges. In this post, we present some of these steps, and share the report into copyright challenges for the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana shares cultural heritage from institutions across Europe, and we see first hand how a lack of copyright knowledge affects not only institutions, but also digital cultural heritage. Inaccurate information about the possibilities for using content makes it less reliable to researchers, educators, creators and life-long learners, and undermines the trust they put in us.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana develops standards which seek to address this: we encourage those who share data with Europeana to follow best practices, such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">not claiming copyright</a> on content that is in the public domain; to assign digital objects a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">rights statement</a>; and to be diligent in providing accurate rights information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also doing research and working to better understand barriers to institutions providing accurate rights information.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, according to the <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/publicaties/research-paper-a-look-at-the-accuracy-of-edmrights-in-the-europeana-database/\">2019</a> accuracy report, rights information is often incorrectly applied in our collections, and this is not an isolated occurrence. Similar challenges exist across the sector. In a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/insights-from-the-europeana-copyright-community-survey\">survey </a>conducted by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Europeana Copyright Community</a>, participants identified “the lack of copyright knowledge among cultural heritage professionals and an absence of training opportunities” as the biggest challenge they faced in the realm of copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And during the May 2020 Europeana aggregators forum meeting, Europeana aggregators provided very useful insights into the ways they deal with copyright when submitting data to Europeana, some of the struggles they face, principles they disagree with, and support they could benefit from.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have summarised our findings from this research in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-state-of-play-of-copyright-knowledge-in-cultural-heritage-institutions\">a short report</a> which outlines our understanding of the main challenges that the cultural heritage sector deals with in relation to copyright. And with this in mind, we have come up with some tangible steps to support those who share data with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We strive to support the broader sector, and hope that these steps will help us shape how this can happen, and move in that direction. They aim to provide greater clarity around our frameworks and standards, clarify how to use rights statements and creative commons license and tools, and build knowledge of copyright, particularly to the extent that it is necessary when sharing data with Europeana:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We will update information on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/copyright\">copyright page</a> dedicated to our data partners, and add some more relevant sources and materials such as flowcharts, examples or FAQs.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We will more actively communicate our copyright updates and related information with data partners.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>In the autumn and winter of 2020 - 2021, we will be running\_ a series of webinars on specific topics of particular interest to data partners and the cultural heritage institutions which they work with. Look out for more information on Europeana Pro news.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We will evaluate the usefulness of these actions. At the same time, we are considering some longer-term actions, including\_ supporting national or aggregator specific workshops with contributions or materials, initiating a campaign to raise awareness of how to accurately select a rights statement, and respecting the public domain, or providing some other forms of copyright training.\_</p>\r\n"

But how much, and what exactly, do cultural heritage professionals need to know? This question is key for Europana, particularly as we advance towards building more capacity, and strive to identify how to best support the sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The copyright knowledge gap keeps evolving (hopefully in the right direction), and research is constantly necessary. We might not have a complete answer to the question, but we have several pieces of a puzzle that we bring together in this report.\_</p>\r\n"

The Network of European Museum Organisations (NEMO) has created <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=17-4zW7VeebnCetu54fNo-wukxY6KcrgG&amp;ll=52.493534879770834%2C14.278045999999982&amp;z=4\">a map of Europe </a>showing the current situation in each country and the dates that cultural institutions are allowed to open there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=17-4zW7VeebnCetu54fNo-wukxY6KcrgG\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And not all institutions are ready to let people in on the first day they are allowed to. Each institution has its own challenges and has to balance expectations and revenue with safety and practicalities. So while some, like the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/visitor-information\">Rijksmuseum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/visit/plan-your-visit/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo6D4BRDgARIsAA6uN1_qE43TzW8fJJoZFhJHlPUgy4IayeDICA-az__iU06zB1EHrRBr3mIaAiNNEALw_wcB\">Mauritshuis</a> opened up on the first day they could (1 June) with limited numbers and pre-booking required, others like the <a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/preparer-sa-visite\">Louvre</a> delayed their opening. Museums in France were allowed to open on 2 June but the Louvre opened its doors on 6 July.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Opening up messaging</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are going to open again, you need to tell people all about it. The Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands, has done a beautiful job of this with a video based on their building and collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"nl\">Het Mauritshuis is weer open!<br />\r\nVerheug je alvast op je bezoek en bereid je goed voor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZien we je snel weer?

Anna Witek, Senior Programme Specialist at FINA tells us about it: ‘We show movies in our beautiful courtyard, while the audience sits on deckchairs, listening to the movies with a silent disco sound system (we don’t bother the neighbours this way). Our guests love it and they come in crowds every year.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this year’s experience - the first activities of FINA’s reopening - will be a little different. Anna says, ‘We are launching the programme in mid-July. It is going to be a real challenge, both for us and for our visitors. As organisers we currently face problems with proper sanitary conditions and safety rules for the screenings. Despite all the obstacles and the extra work, we are dedicated to making the project happen because we believe it is the core of our summer activity, giving our audience a very special cinematic and, at the same time, community-bonding experience. And we think this year we all need it even more than ever before.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Opening up inside</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you do get to go inside a cultural institution, you’re likely to find routes around the building limited. A <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/a-more-guided-visit-how-to-reopen-museums-and-galleries-safely-141819\">report from the Turing Institute</a> based on the behaviour of (pre-pandemic) visitors to the British Museum found that most visitors wander around the museum, not following defined paths. Less than a quarter are what they call ‘Committed trekkers’ - those that spend a long time on their visit and see many objects. It is this group that the study suggests are most suited to the kind of restricted and controlled visits possible right now. Taha Yasseri of the Turing Institute suggests that splitting one site into ‘multiple isolated sub-museums’ might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s what the National Gallery in London has done. There are three prescribed one-way routes around the gallery. Writing for the BBC, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53315448\">Will Gompertz</a> says, ‘Each trail takes around 30 minutes and features hundreds of stunning paintings.’ He says these new normal walking tours have a lot going for them, even though, ‘The defined routes are like motorways, once you're on one you have to go with the flow until the next exit’. He concludes that they are ‘an intelligent solution to a difficult situation: turning expert curators into art-route planners might be more than a quick fix, it could be the future.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Opening up to the future</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.bcucluj.ro/en\"> Lucian Blaga Central University Library </a>in Romania has also found that its crisis strategy has potential to be part of its future. To enable students to continue their academic studies during the crisis, they teamed up with Babeş-Bolyai University to digitise the bibliography for all curriculum subjects taught online during the lockdown. ‘The crisis forced the library to re-evaluate certain services and to rethink a crisis strategy that works in the short term,’ says Florina Ilis, Head of the Department of Bibliographic Research and Documentation. ‘But in the long-term, the strategy that worked successfully during the COVID-19 crisis will be improved and adapted.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Florina reflects that the library means more than delivering books quickly through&nbsp; an online environment. ‘We have tried to think of future strategies to protect ourselves from the danger of depersonalising the library. I believe that, following the Europeana model, libraries should develop and provide narratives around specific, valuable and open-ended collections. A first step was taken by our library by developing a portal dedicated to the First World War. I believe that this should continue and expand towards new historical, cultural, artistic and social themes. As such, the most important elements we need are creativity and imagination. These are the main things (acquisitions) that we became aware of during the health crisis of COVID-19.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe\">Explore more #DiscoveringEurope initiatives</a> and <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/34467373cc8c4e1a87e88b3f35faef00\">share your reopening activities with us</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Building capacity in our sector - where we are'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In May we launched a phased project to help us identify and shape a capacity-building framework for digital transformation. Here, we recap on the project so far and share our thoughts on the process as we move towards scaling up the second phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>The project so far\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>2020 has been quite a year. COVID-19 brought about an arguably unparalleled examination of what ‘digital’ is, means and can be for the cultural heritage sector, for our audiences, stakeholders, and us - professionals working in cultural heritage. It has provided us all with challenges and opportunities, and in May we launched a phased project to help us identify and shape a capacity-building framework for digital transformation based on the needs of our sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first phase of this project we wanted to gain a greater understanding of how our sector was doing in this time of crisis - to make sense of ‘the now’. We aimed to do this in two ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, throughout June our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-how-our-workshops-support-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’ workshops</a> brought together the perspective, experience and expertise of thought-leaders and do-ers in the sector to help identify new paths through - and beyond - the COVID-19 crisis for digital cultural heritage. Facilitated by Michael Peter Edson and Jasper Visser, 64 participants from 22 countries came together to identify opportunities for growth and positive action whilst also shedding light on Europeana’s strategic mission to ‘empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While our workshops were exploring issues and needs on the ground, a separate but complementary <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-digital-transformation-across-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">report undertaken by Culture 24</a> looked to explore what is happening in our sector to support digital capacity and what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sensemaking our reports\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of these processes have now concluded, and as a result, we have an immense amount of information, insight and inspiration contained in two very rich reports. These respectively bring out the themes and ideas collaboratively brought together during the workshops sessions in June, and offer a scan of sectoral initiatives and eight interviews with digital thought-leaders.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a combined length of over 120 pages, the reports raise new questions and possibilities on each reading. The insights they offer, and possibilities they suggest, are immensely rich, and we are looking forward to sharing them. However, we want to make sure that we do this in a way that makes them meaningful, accessible and valuable for the professionals who make up our wide and diverse sector. We want to be clear on what they mean for us as an organisation and wider network, and to present them in a way that allows us to support the sector in building capacity for its digital transformation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So over the summer, we will be going through a structured process to perform a number of ‘deep dives’ on these reports.\_ We are looking into the shared findings, interrogating our own assumptions and planning ways to package, build on and develop the findings from the reports. Once we have completed this process, we will share these reports with you in September, and offer a number of different ways to engage with, and understand, the insight they offer.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How to contribute and stay informed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From start to finish this project has been designed to be collaborative, and your collective input has been, and will continue to be vital. In the next stage of this project we will look to scale up, involving more voices and perspectives from across the sector. If you are interested in contributing to this process, we encourage you to complete <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/g3lgpL\">this short form</a>. You’ll be the first to hear about the next steps for the project and opportunities to get involved.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking a little further ahead, we’re planning November’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2020 conference</a> to reflect new directions and processes influenced by the collaborative output from this project.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, over the next five or six weeks you can look out for some Pro News posts from participants in the workshops, register to to ensure you are the first to hear when we publish the report and about other opportunities to contribute to the project, and share your thoughts with us and others using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuildDigitalCapacity?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live\">#BuildDigitalCapacity</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Exploring the CoGhent Project'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In June, Europeana brought together 60 cultural heritage professionals from across Europe for a special series of peer-to-peer workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, Jasper Visser - one of the process’s facilitators - interviews participant Oliver D’huynslager of <a href=\"https://www.designmuseumgent.be/en/\">Design Museum Ghent</a> on his experiences in the workshops and the new and exciting ‘CoGhent’ project.\_\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Together with your colleagues in Ghent, you have been awarded funding for an ambitious project in Europe’s Urban Innovation Actions program: CoGhent. What does the CoGhent project aim to achieve?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most cities in Europe are digitising their cultural collections, but often lack the tools to leverage this cultural data to engage their citizens. The data is stuck within institutional silos or used on digital platforms which don’t reach out to new audiences because they lack an open infrastructure. One of the main goals of CoGhent is to establish the necessary data architecture and a city-broad data management plan, mainly focused on cultural institutions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resulting technology will be given a permanent place in the future wing of the Design Museum Gent named DING. By linking heritage on a city level, using it as a foundation to capture and show stories in cultural spaces, we want to leverage digitised heritage to be used engagingly and purposefully as a shared connection amongst citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CoGhent aims to improve cultural participation and social cohesion through the use of digitised cultural heritage, especially with new audiences. How do you think digital cultural heritage and open data can contribute to improving social cohesion?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end goal is not merely to open up cultural data; it is about making it useful, usable, and used, about creating Open Knowledge. By offering the tools to crowdsource citizen-stories and citizen-insight on our shared cultural heritage, and making use of linked data to foster cultural diversity and raise its visibility, we hope to increase tolerance for one another and enhance social cohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the values underlying CoGhent, and how do you make sure these values are what drive the innovation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the project is very data-driven and tech-heavy, it departs from a set of R&amp;D activities. We will be conducting user-research to figure out which data to open up to our target audience, so hope to have a good understanding of which data could be valuable for both the end-user and museum professional. The challenge in this project is finding the right balance between values-based innovation and also keeping it generic and open enough to transfer to other cities.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is not your first attempt to use digital tools to make collections more accessible. The project ‘<a href=\"https://motfp.be/\">Museum of Things for People</a>’ served a similar goal. How does the Museum of Things project relate to the CoGhent project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museum of Things for People had a particular goal; to explore the potential of IoT (Internet of Things) in the gallery space. Making use of ultra-wideband\_ - a radio technology for high precision locating and tracking applications - to track visitor movement, the museum offered visitors recommendations at the end of their visit. However, in order to make these suggestions we were very dependent on mature and linked (open) data. The lack of both internal and external data sources meant the manual input of these recommendations instead of leveraging the capabilities offered through using linked open data, which lies at the heart of the CoGhent project.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You were\_a participant in Europeana’s sense-making process about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">digital transformation in the time of COVID-19</a>. What do you think is the impact of COVID-19 on CoGhent and similar initiatives?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museums gather people to experience art and each other’s perspectives. Until we restore our confidence in public spaces, we need to think about how to come together differently. I firmly believe that COVID-19 will give momentum to similar projects that are in some way trying to develop these new kinds of (digital) spaces. A connection is often made through sharing stories, and that is precisely what we are trying to platform.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Were there any new ideas or approaches you heard about in the workshops which you’d like to explore in your work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What struck me the most was how we are all becoming very dependent on digital technology and are seemingly forced to change and adapt our practices to its logic. This, however, is a very precarious situation to be in. We need to safeguard our values when moving into this digital domain. When thinking about digital in the museum context I often look for past pivotal moments and ask myself; ‘would we have done any different when we had the same digital tools back then as we have now?’. However digital might be here to stay, I believe that museums don’t need to completely reinvent themselves. Instead, they need to figure out what works for them, both past and future tense, and how technology might elevate on this.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about this project, please <a href=\"mailto:Olivier.VanDhuynslager@stad.gent\">contact Olivier</a>.</p>\r\n"

As a result, digital repository and online access platforms developed for cultural heritage institutions have focused on these formats as well. However, in recent years, advances in digital storage and digitisation technologies have allowed institutions to undertake greater efforts to digitise audio and moving image collections, while at the same time, interest on the part of scholars and the general public in working with such collections has increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indiana University (IU) is home to numerous AV collections spanning multiple departments and campuses, with a wide range of content genres, formats, and users. These collections include a large <a href=\"https://libraries.indiana.edu/music-library\">music library and performance archive</a>, extensive <a href=\"https://libraries.indiana.edu/archives-traditional-music\">ethnomusicological</a> and ethnographic collections, and a growing <a href=\"https://libraries.indiana.edu/moving-image-archive\">moving image archive</a>, among others. Starting in 2015, a <a href=\"https://mdpi.iu.edu/\">large project was undertaken</a> to digitize over 300,000 rare and unique items from these collections, which&nbsp; needed a system that could support access, in conjunction with other systems to support digital preservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A repository for audiovisual access</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recognising the need for better repository and access platforms for audiovisual (AV) materials, the libraries of <a href=\"https://libraries.indiana.edu/\">Indiana University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.library.northwestern.edu/\">Northwestern University</a> had already set out in 2011 to collaboratively develop an open-source repository platform focused on AV access, known as <a href=\"https://www.avalonmediasystem.org/\">Avalon Media System</a>. Based on the&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.samvera.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596611080995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxeZfeUSV9kjx1W80FW3Yl-p9tCA\" href=\"https://www.samvera.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Samvera</a>&nbsp;technology stack and freely available under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Avalon is designed to allow any collection-holding institute to provide access to digital AV collections and is now used by at least a dozen other institutions beyond its initial developers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Avalon is as flexible as possible and supports a wide range of modalities for content discovery and access. Users can find an item in Avalon through use of its own built-in search and browse, but they might also discover items through a web search engine such as Google, a local- or network-level library discovery layer, or links from within a course site or online exhibit. Avalon’s media player can be used within the Avalon web interface itself, but it may also be easily embedded into other sites via an iframe. This embeddability has supported uses such as hosting of media used within <a href=\"https://collections.libraries.indiana.edu/IULMIA/exhibits/show/world-war-ii-propaganda-films\">online exhibits</a>, <a href=\"https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca31.4.02/385\">electronic journal articles</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/12/16/iu-putting-1970-s-beer-and-ice-cream-commercials-online-and-theyre-hilarious/958080001/\">news stories</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Annotating material</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scholars and users also want to be able to annotate media collections, something Indiana University has been working on since the early 2000s. But for audiovisual material, this had yet to be standardised. The ideal, in the world of AV annotation, has been a standard that would allow the separation of an annotation tool from the backend repository and delivery platform, allowing scholars to mix and match tools as appropriate for their research needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The emergence of native browser AV support in HTML5 offered part of the solution, but it still left gaps for how repositories might offer audiovisual files along with metadata related to rights, description, and structure, and support controlled, authenticated access for content that cannot be made openly available. The emerging&nbsp;<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF) community had solved many of these same problems for access to still images, and the community’s interest in extending these principles and technologies into the world of moving images and audio is exciting. Avalon was actively getting engaged in planning work that ultimately led to the development of the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/\">IIIF Presentation API 3.0</a> standard, released in its final form in June in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The current version of Avalon automatically generates IIIF Presentation 3.0-compatible manifest files for all items, which may be used to play back Avalon content in other IIIF-compatible tools such as the <a href=\"https://universalviewer.io/\">Universal Viewer</a>. Avalon is also integrated with an audio annotation tool that consumes IIIF manifests and audio from Avalon to support hierarchical annotation of musical form, which itself in turn is saved as a new IIIF manifest. In the future, there are plans to rework Avalon to use IIIF standards internally for interoperability between its player and backend and to enable better integration of media content housed in Avalon into other environments such as online exhibits and archival finding aids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested in IIIF AV presentation tools? <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/iiif-europeana-working-group\">Join the IIIF and EuropeanaTech working group.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />As we saw in Europeana’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries/masks-and-head-coverings\">Masks and head coverings</a> gallery, masks are as old as humankind and have been used for protection, ceremony, tradition and fashion. But the Covid-19 crisis has triggered a renaissance of masks, and two Serbian museums have recently launched the production of fashionable and comfortable masks based on their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/novi-vek/\">National Museum in Belgrade </a>(NMB) was closed to visitors between 16 March to 22 April. The Museum then&nbsp;opened its doors again, but with certain conditions: all visitors have to pass a disinfecting area and disinfect their hands at the museum entrance, and body temperature readings are mandatory both for employees and visitors. Finally, face masks are compulsory - but it is now possible to buy beautiful masks based on the museum's collections in the museum shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sell-out masks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Biljana Djordjević, PhD, Museum Advisor, Head of Documentation Department and Museum Shop Manager at NMB tells us about it: ’Gordana Grabež, executive director in NMB, is responsible for the production of masks inspired by the NMB collection. Her first idea was to equip our staff with the appropriate masks, so we have given two masks to each museum employee and the rest are being sold in the museum shop. Since launching the masks, they have been extremely well received and are in high demand: each collection is sold out in two days after appearing in the shop.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Socially responsible&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>‘They are very comfortable to wear and can be used repeatedly, as they are made of special washable paper. At a price of 1.70 EUR, they’re affordable for the general public. The National Museum, as a socially responsible institution, made a policy not to earn money on this product, but to raise awareness among citizens about the importance of wearing masks in this challenging time. At the same time, the National Museum is educating citizens via captions of the art works on the masks, because people normally prefer to know what is on their face! We’re using around 40 motifs now, and also have four designs for children’s masks.’</p>\r\n"

These masks are more expensive (7.20 EUR), but are very elegant and dedicated to special occasions. NMB is also in partnership with Maruska to create silk masks, as seen in the photo below.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Cultural heritage in lockdown</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first part of 2020, museums were severely affected by the lockdowns enforced by governments around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While closed, museums promoted a broad range of digital projects and activities to continue supporting access to cultural heritage and maintain a relationship with their audiences. Many of these activities have also been highlighted in, and supported by, the media, besides being followed with new curiosity by home-bound audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Museums have drawn on their existing resources, such as online collection portals and social media accounts. They have also delivered new content, such as virtual exhibitions, curatorial talks and virtual tours of their galleries via streaming platforms, and educational material for children and adults (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/creative-approaches-and-collaborations\">explore examples of such creative approaches&nbsp;on Europeana Pro</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On social media, users shared their own re-creation of famous artworks using everyday objects in their houses (using the hashtags #tussenkunstenquarantaine or #gettymuseumchallenge); cultural heritage professionals shared singular objects and stories from their collections using a variety of hashtags (including #MuseumFromHome, #MuseumsUnlocked, #ClosedButOpen, #ClosedButActive, #ArTyouReady); museums joined TikTok (such as the Uffizi, who has been active on this platform since April); and in the new release of the Nintendo franchise <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, gamers could add work of arts from institutions including the Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have been equally fascinated and interested by the innovative ways museums have contributed to the online recreational and informative activities of a broad range of audiences in this period – and in the impact they will have on future digital practices in the sector. For this reason, I have started to document these digital initiatives on a map.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The map</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The map, available <a href=\"https://digitalmuseums.at/\">here</a>, aims to collect and show digital activities developed and promoted by museums during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current dataset is being compiled with the help of Sabrina Melcher, student assistant at the University of Graz, and through crowdsourcing. The categories we chose to sort the various initiatives are: contemporary collecting projects; social media initiatives (i.e. local hashtags and targeted projects); streaming content; virtual tours; online exhibitions; game; educational content; and other types of activities (for initiatives not covered by the previous categories).&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

In the future, we aim to further develop our categorisation, identifying more subsets in the types of activities. We are also interested in clustering activities around similar uses of technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the case of social media data, although different hashtags have been collected, we chose to show only the #ClosedbutActive Twitter dataset on the map.&nbsp;We chose to show a single Twitter dataset as an example of the reach of this specific hashtag, as due to their volume and size, other social media data would have overwhelmed the presentation and slowed down the website. We aim to showcase the results of the analysis of the other social media data in future visualisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We discuss the purpose and rationale behind this map in more detail in an article published in the magazine <em>Cultural Practice</em> - <a href=\"https://culturalpractice.org/digital-responses-from-locked-down-museums/\">read it here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Contribute to the map and learn more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are continuously looking for new projects and updating the map in order to build a richer collection of museums’ digital initiatives. We believe in the value of crowdsourcing and want to invite museums and cultural heritage professionals to share their projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This can be done through a short form (it takes less than 10 minutes to complete), which is available in different languages (English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Russian, Spanish). You can submit multiple forms, depending on the number of activities you wish to share on the map. Once a form is completed, we will check and geocode the activity, and a marker will then be added to the map with a description and a link to your digital project. We are looking forward to your help enriching this resource!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Novel methodology to measure impact</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The growing collections of digitised and increasingly born-digital data have opened unprecedented opportunities for exploitation by creative industries and individual citizens. Yet the economic and societal benefits of these activities are not always immediately obvious and fail to demonstrate the return on investment in digitisation and digital strategies for public engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">inDICEs is developing a novel methodology that will evaluate the wide-spread effects of this digital revolution and guide its future evolution. With this, it aims to further support the investment in digitisation and the creation of frameworks for accessible and reusable cultural assets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our methodology combines three strands of research:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">understanding and measuring the socioeconomic impact of access to cultural goods and services and new modes of content production that have been enabled by digital cultural heritage;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">mapping Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regulations on a national and international level to identify areas where policies need to be aligned with practices to enable the promotion and exploitation of cultural assets;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">developing new business models and best practices that help individual organisations to overcome bottlenecks in creative reuse and consumption of digital heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An open observatory for the cultural heritage sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While inDICEs is still in its first year, we have an ambitious goal to build an open observatory with three core elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Participatory space</strong>: a collaborative online environment for deliberation, co-creation and transparent dialogue between policy-makers, cultural heritage professionals, researchers and creative industry representatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Visual analytics</strong>: inDICEs is currently performing large-scale analysis on various data concerning copyright policies and trends, user engagement with digital culture and more. To make sense of data, we will use narrative-based data visualisations that demonstrate patterns and links between access to digital heritage and its socioeconomic impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Self-assessment tool</strong>: individual CHIs will be able to assess the impact of their digital collections and identify changes to their business models that would help to increase it.</p>\r\n"

The aim of the workshop is to understand the needs and concerns of CHI professionals regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and value chains, future research competencies and change management. Participants will have a chance to use our participatory space to actively join the discussion and share their knowledge and observations. You can find the full programme and register for the workshop <a href=\"https://participate.indices-culture.eu/conferences/chiconsultation\">here</a>. Be quick as the number of spaces is limited!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in our project outcomes?

                body: "<h3><strong>The challenges of closing doors</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following worldwide lockdowns prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://epicchq.com/\">EPIC, the Irish Immigration Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.imj.org.il/en\">Israel Museum, Jerusalem</a> closed their doors in March, a step which presented challenges for both institutions. As Nathan reflects, ‘It wasn’t an easy decision to make just before St. Patrick’s Day - traditionally Dublin’s largest annual celebration and the start of the tourist season. Group bookings had to be cancelled and refunded, temporary exhibitions postponed, events moved online and offices closed.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The uncertainty of the situation was also difficult. Susan writes that, ‘I think all of us were in shock at the time; fearful for our family and friends’ health, and uncertain what this meant for the Museum. Along with the rest of the world, no one had any idea of how long before we could open our doors again.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New initiatives and rethinking</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the challenges, both institutions began new initiatives to engage their audiences from home. Susan writes, ‘We decided that this was the perfect time to showcase our digital content, framed in a specially designed, responsive website.&nbsp; The new home page read “The Museum is closed – Come in!”&nbsp; and opened up a wealth of digital content, including virtual tours of Museum galleries, videos from closed exhibitions, as well as webinars, salons and podcasts. Social media campaigns extended our reach, and special emphasis was given to children’s activities.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Staff at EPIC also began to work on new initiatives. Nathan writes, ‘What began as a scramble to get equipment to staff members’ homes soon became something altogether more wonderful. Early on, the Museum’s senior management team took the decision to keep on all staff who wished to remain working, albeit remotely. Our team of 20 front of house and retail staff were retrained and redeployed to assist with other department’s projects. They helped to research, design and deliver new education resource packs and workshops, themed tour routes, biographical information sheets, blog posts and much more. We began to rethink how we worked, how we communicated and what kind of museum we wanted to present to our visitors and patrons when we reopened.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Re-opening&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That moment came for EPIC in June when, after being closed for almost four months, the museum reopened to the public. Based on the work of an internal COVID-19 response team, the Museum has put a number of precautions in place. Nathan describes how, ‘A new, colour coded booking system visible online and at the museum’s front desk lets visitors know how busy the galleries are. Admission is capped at 25 people every 15 minutes to ensure all visitors are evenly spread out.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Sterilised stylus pens are provided to all visitors to use on the museum’s interactive screens, minimising surface contact while allowing us to keep our touch screens in use. Regular and visible cleaning of all surfaces by museum staff has proven very popular with visitors. Additionally, members of the public no longer find the ubiquitous bright yellow COVID-19 public signage engaging and rarely take notice of it. We changed all of our relevant signage to ‘hot pink’ and personalised the messaging – it has proven far more effective.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

While we make every effort to ensure proper social distancing, we must also remember to maintain our human connectivity, in whatever ways we can.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Susan is also excited to see the Israel Museum reopen as a space for visitors to connect. She writes, ‘When I spoke about our much-loved Museum during the Lunch Café discussion, I still had no idea of a reopening date. We are all set now for our upcoming re-opening on 13 August with three curatorial wings, 27 departments and 15 special exhibitions waiting to open their doors. The new COVID-19 rules prescribed by the authorities are already in place, including an online health declaration form for staff and visitors.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘There is a certain excitement in the air and real yearning to be able to explore the galleries once again. Our beautiful Art Garden, designed by the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, and the vast Museum campus awaits visitors who have spent many months at home - the perfect place for families and friends to come together to relax, enjoy and breathe deep once again.’</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Transcriptions, subtitles and enrichments: sharing our copyright approach'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana increasingly relies on content generated by users or machines which adds value to the cultural heritage data we share, and makes it\_accessible and reusable. This content raises new questions, including ones related to copyright: what can we enrich and transcribe, and how do we label, or license, the results? In this post, we share our thoughts and ask our<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-cb9666d9-7fff-2fdf-970a-ade3965207a1\">\_</b>partners, networks and data providers for feedback.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>What user generated content does Europeana work with, and why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, the user or machine generated content that Europeana works with consists of annotations and enrichments, including\_semantic enrichment and transcriptions or subtitles. For instance, through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crowd-heritage\">CrowdHeritage project</a>, Europeana worked with\_partners to facilitate the creation and integration of enrichments and annotations on content in Europeana, and through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enrich-europeana\">EnrichEuropeana project</a>, several handwritten items in Europeana have been transcribed.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>User generated content offers many promising possibilities. It enriches collections, helps us make them more interoperable, brings us closer to having more translated content, and contributes to accessibility.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What rights statements do we suggest applying to the content generated by users?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to continue fostering the usability of content in Europeana, we are defining an approach to\_user generated content that defends the principles of openness. We want to align how we treat user generated content from a copyright perspective to the conditions we apply to metadata and digital objects provided by our data partners.\_More specifically, we are exploring\_the following possibilities:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Enrichments and annotations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our view, enrichments and annotations should be treated in the same way as the\_metadata provided by our data partners. As such, the enrichments and annotations contributed by a user should be made available under the terms of the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a>, which allows anyone to use these with no restrictions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Transcriptions and subtitles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our terms, we are planning to ask people contributing with transcriptions and subtitles to not claim any intellectual property rights that could, in some exceptional cases, be generated from their act of transcribing or subtitling. This avoids adding additional layers of rights that would hamper further uses of transcriptions and subtitles, for instance to support accessibility or multilinguality.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in order to respect intellectual property rights that might exist on the content or digital objects that the transcription or subtitles result from, all transcriptions and subtitles contributed by the user will be made available by Europeana under the rights statement assigned to this content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is our internal approach to what can be enriched, transcribed or subtitled?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright and the rights statements chosen by Europeana data partners determine the extent to which digital objects in Europeana can be used. We should base our decision to transcribe and subtitle digital content on the terms these indicate and our willingness to encourage the use of digital objects licensed openly. We\_are therefore considering not supporting the transcription or creation of subtitles of any digital objects marked with <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a>, <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-OKLR/1.0/\">NoC-OKLR</a>, <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/\">InC</a>, <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/\">InC-EDU</a>, <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-OW-EU/1.0/\">InC-EU-OW</a> or <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/CNE/1.0/\">CNE</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, even though digital objects marked as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a> and <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-NC/1.0/\">NoC-NC</a> would in principle allow us to create a literal transcription of a handwritten letter, challenges would rise if eventually we wanted to promote its use by anyone, in any platform. We therefore consider it best to focus our efforts to transcribe and subtitle content on digital objects marked as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">PDM</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a> or <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can encourage the creation of metadata enrichments without discriminating in terms of the rights statement applied to the content, and will be diligent in ensuring that this metadata is differentiated from the one provided by Europeana data partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are the next steps?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make this approach clear to users contributing with content, we need to update our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/rights/terms-for-user-contributions\">Terms for User Contributions</a>. These terms set the conditions that apply to the content individuals and institutions contribute to Europeana, and have been developed so that there is clarity on how this content can be used. They now need to be updated to accommodate the many exciting projects which bring in annotations, metadata enrichments, transcriptions, subtitles and other types of user or machine generated content.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, before we do that, we would like to collect feedback, ideas, thoughts and concerns around this topic from our partners, data providers, members of our networks and the broader public, so please <a href=\"mailto:info@europeana.eu\">reach out to us</a> with your comments. For more information on our general approach to copyright, check out the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Saint George on a Bike leverages the power of AI for European cultural heritage'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Saint George on a Bike is a Generic Services project which aims to improve the quality and quantity of open metadata associated with imagery from European cultural heritage. In this post, the project team take a look at what it aims to achieve.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>AI will now be well-versed in cultural heritage thanks to the new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Saint George on a Bike project</a> coordinated by the <a href=\"https://www.bsc.es/\">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>. The project has begun training machine learning algorithms in culture, symbols, and historical contexts with the aim of automatically generating rich metadata for hundreds of thousands of images from various European cultural heritage repositories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enable access to collections of cultural heritage images, platforms like Europeana require high quality metadata. However, human experts from libraries, archives and museums simply cannot produce fine-grained descriptions for all the resources that result from massive digitisation programs. To alleviate this bottleneck, researchers are looking at employing AI technology to automate at least a part of the description process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But training AI to be aware of cultural heritage contexts is not as simple as teaching it to identify different objects in a modern picture. Saint George on a Bike is fine-tuning the algorithms so that they 'think' in context and time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The AI we are developing will be able to tell whether a painting shows Saint George on a horse or a bike,” said Maria Cristina Marinescu, coordinator of the project and senior researcher at the Computer Applications in Science and Engineering department (CASE) of BSC. “This is not as easy as it sounds because the shapes are similar. By training it in various cultural heritage elements, including the first appearance of the objects depicted and the period the painting is from, the AI algorithm would conclude that a 16th century painting of Saint George would logically depict a horse rather than a bike.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will serve as the main test-bed for the metadata enrichments generated by the project. Antoine Isaac, R&amp;D Manager at Europeana Foundation, says, \"Existing AI tools tend to underperform when applied to cultural heritage collections, because they are trained on modern documents and material that is not cultural heritage based. If Saint George on a Bike manages to create computer vision tools that properly recognize our contexts, Europeana will be able to support a richer browsing and discovery experience for the cultural collections of our partners.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Saint George on a Bike project is holding webinars on the 9 - 10 September to demonstrate the project results and potential to adapt automatically produced descriptions of paintings to the time period when they were created. Researchers in data mining and data science with an interest in art and culture are welcome to attend!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Unlocking the Europeana Network Association’s potential'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Since the launch of our membership campaign, over the past few months we’ve seen an increasing number of people with rich perspectives joining the Europeana Network Association (ENA). In this post, we explore what motivates people to join the ENA, and outline how we aim to build on and harness their experience to engage them in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In the ENA, we bring together cultural heritage professionals from all domains and from all over Europe, and beyond. In April, we launched a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/renew-your-membership-and-keep-working-with-us-in-the-europeana-network-association\">membership campaign</a> to ask\_our members to renew their commitment to ENA by 1 October 2020.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that time however, we have also seen around 100 new members with compelling profiles, knowledge and expertise joining our Network on a monthly basis.\_Overall, membership has increased by almost 500 people in the past half year, and now stands at over 3,100 members. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-de-niet\">Marco de Niet</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a>, who on behalf of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">ENA Management Board</a> regularly review new membership requests, have expressed pride in the growth of the ENA, and the willingness of its members to take on new initiatives related to recent events and ongoing imperatives for our sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why professionals join the ENA\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From the preliminary results of the ENA impact assessment and satisfaction survey that we ran in June 2020, it appears that many members find the ENA a lively community of inspiring professionals and a place to initiate new projects.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the survey, new members are motivated to join the Network because of the opportunities for networking and collaboration in a community, thought-leadership of the ENA, and the chance to share knowledge, expertise and experiences with other like-minded professionals in the GLAM sector across Europe and worldwide. People also join to keep up to date on the latest developments within the sector, and to attend and co-organise events with Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some new members state that they wish to support and promote the activities of Europeana. For example, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sabrina-ferrazzi\">Sabrina Ferrazzi</a>, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Verona and new ENA member, writes, ‘Both my PhD and my actual research are in the field of Cultural Heritage Law. I think that digitalisation is a fundamental tool for the future of cultural heritage. For this reason, I really appreciate the opportunity to connect with the Community to study the topic in depth and be of help.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another new member, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/david-kretschek\">David Kretschek</a>, Professor at the Federal University of Technology, Parana, Brazil, also joined the ENA because of the value he places on open access to heritage and a desire to contribute to this through the Network: ‘As an educator I believe learning should not be restricted and knowledge must be accessible... culture is a great subject to showcase the potential of open knowledge and education to society in general. Therefore [I joined] the Europeana Network to stay in touch with modern cultural heritage tendencies and contribute the way I can to the development of a more open education.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Sabrina and David, many of those\_now joining the Network are professionals with interest in cultural heritage and research, education and teaching, technological development, policy or copyright. New members tend to come across Europeana via professional involvement or because their own institution has collaborated with Europeana, but we also see a growing number of people from other continents.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Nurturing our membership\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to keep working to improve people’s experience of joining the ENA, and to have a dedicated, long-term instrument in place to facilitate a rewarding experience of ENA membership. We have been looking for new ways to utilize the potential of our members and explore how they can contribute to the ENA in fulfilling and meaningful ways, while maintaining ongoing communication flows.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, the ENA will create a Working Group dedicated to assessing the membership benefits, looking to engage ENA members in new ways and overall make the ENA more inclusive and diverse. The Working Group will build on input from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a>, which came to existence as a result of a discussion during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-conversation-on-inclusivity-and-diversity-reflections-from-europeana-2019\">Inclusivity &amp; Diversity session of the Europeana 2019 event</a>, and will provide recommendations on how to better support emerging professionals.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ENA, we would also like to encourage a more balanced regional representation, organise more local events, enable more multilingual collaborations, and provide more opportunities for students and new professionals to get involved. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">ENA Members Council</a> will look for the right ways to achieve these goals. We will keep you informed about their next steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, we would like to stress how much we\_value our current members and their ongoing contribution to the ENA. If you are a member, don’t forget to renew your membership before 1 October in a membership confirmation request email you should have received from us - if you haven’t, please check your spam folder, and stay tuned for more news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not yet a member of the ENA, and would like to join our growing community, you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up here</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

In the 2020-2021 school year, we will create an online course to help educators create their own eLearning Activities and offer a series of webinars that demonstrate how to design eLearning Activities with specific learning outcomes in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the partner pages, we will make it possible for users to search for sources from the digital collections of institutions who give access to their collections via Europeana, using licenses that allow for use in education. We will also build a dashboard which offers insights into the educational resources of our partners, and make it possible to add more sources from the Europeana collections website to Historiana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, we will research how students and teachers are using Historiana in practice to explore how to improve our website design and create more free resources with historians and educators from our network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">visit the Historiana website</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fayqc-LGrpo\">explore a webinar</a> which demonstrates the new features of Historiana, or contact <a href=\"mailto:steven@euroclio.eu\">steven@euroclio.eu</a>.</p>\r\n"

This is a piece of information in the metadata which describes the extent to which someone can use the digital object. While this may sound like a simple step, it often raises many questions that need to be answered to make the correct choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dedicated <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/copyright\">Copyright page on Europeana Pro</a> offers help and guidance to our data partners selecting a rights statement, but we are also excited to announce a new series of webinars which will further help our data partners and cultural heritage institutions navigate the topic of copyright when submitting data to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These will take place throughout the autumn and winter of 2020-2021. The webinars were developed in collaboration with the Europeana Aggregators' Forum (EAF), the Europe-wide network of data partners enabling cultural heritage institutions to share their content with Europeana and open it up to new audiences.\_ Topics were selected through conversations with individual aggregators and the EAF Steering Group, and will focus on the frameworks and standards which Europeana and data partners work with. We will dive into some key questions regarding managing copyright in cultural heritage institutions, and share relevant examples and best practices. The webinars are open to all, including professionals from institutions which do not share data with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Topics and speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A webinar on <strong>'Rights in digital objects &amp; structured rights information at Europeana'</strong> will kick off the series in <strong>September</strong>. Maša Škrinjar and Ariadna Matas will explain how the copyright status of a collection item relates to the process of choosing a rights statement, license or tool; present the standardised tools that Europeana works with; walk the audience through how to use these and important aspects to note; and showcase these processes through relevant examples. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/rights-in-digital-objects-and-structured-rights-information-at-europeana\">Watch the recording of this webinar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second webinar in <strong>October </strong>will be led by <a href=\"https://naomikorn.com/team_members/naomi-korn/\">Naomi Korn</a>, founder and managing director of Naomi Korn Associates, who will walk the audience through <strong>'Clearing rights in collection items'</strong>. Naomi will talk about the layers of rights that need to be considered before making content available online, and will demonstrate the good practice and approaches that she has contributed to developing. This webinar is likely to be followed by a second one planned for January. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/clearing-rights-in-collections-part-1\">Watch the recording of this webinar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After having set the scene around how to choose a rights statement and clear rights, in <strong>November </strong>we will move to a less legal, but very relevant conversation: <strong>'Opening up: approaches from cultural heritage institutions across Europe'</strong>. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/karin-glasemann\">Karin Glasemann</a>, Digital Coordinator at the Nationalmuseum Sweden, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/andrea-wallace\">Andrea Wallace</a>, Lecturer in Law at the University of Exeter, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/evelin-heidel\">Evelin Heidel</a>, OpenGlam advocate, from the Europeana Copyright community steering group, will share their experiences and thoughts on existing open access models, their impact, and the role that open access can play for cultural heritage institutions. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/opening-up-approaches-from-cultural-heritage-institutions-across-europe\">Watch the recording of this webinar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong>December</strong>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a>, independent\_advisor, Public Space, will walk us through<strong> 'The copyright directive: new approaches to the public domain and to out of commerce works'</strong>. This webinar will highlight key opportunities the directive presents for the cultural heritage sector, explore the approach that some member states are taking during the implementation, and what to watch out for in the context of your institution, and when sharing data with Europeana. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-copyright-directive-new-approaches-to-the-public-domain-and-to-out-of-commerce-works\">Watch the recording of this webinar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned for more details on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">Europeana events page</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Copyright Community.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Facilitating archival research on the study of Greece in the 1940s'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Digital curation is becoming a familiar concept to many in the cultural heritage sector, but do we realise its potential in making digital cultural heritage reusable for research? In this post, Agiatis Benardou discusses the work of the APOLLONIS Task Force, and the processes it has followed to help researchers access disparate archives to study the 1940s in Greece.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About APOLLONIS</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of the Greek Infrastructure for Digital Arts, Humanities and Language Research and Innovation, <a href=\"https://apollonis-infrastructure.gr/\">APOLLONIS</a>, a designated Task Force led by <a href=\"https://www.athena-innovation.gr/en/home\">ATHENA R.C.</a>, is working on identifying and supporting researchers’ needs when accessing disparate archives. It focuses on archival material from the decade of the 1940s, a turbulent period in Greek history due to its significant events (WWII, Occupation, Opposition, Liberation, Civil War), and has\_assembled digitised historical archives from various providers to shed light on different historical aspects of these events.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force has two main aims:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>To design and develop a joint repository for metadata and indexes for people, organisations, places, times, topics and events, to allow people to search content across different archives</li>\r\n    <li>To\_define digital curation activities and workflows, so that the work taken to develop the repository can be replicated, and support further analysis and processing of the enriched content.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force, which is still underway, includes members from ATHENA R.C., co-ordinator of APOLLONIS, <a href=\"http://www.academyofathens.gr/en\">the Academy of Athens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forth.gr/\">FORTH</a>, the\_<a href=\"https://www.iccs.gr/en/\">Institute of Communications and Computer Systems/NTUA</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.asfa.gr/en/\">Athens School of Fine Arts</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bringing archives together - the process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities of the Task Force are interdisciplinary and varied. From bringing together resources to offering them in a new form to researchers, we are recording our workflows. They include the initial curation process of the digitised archives, ingestion, joint indexing of the data, generation of semantic graph representations and, finally, their publication. Below, we detail the processes the Task Force went through to achieve this.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we acquired the source materials, we investigated their structure and content in order to map different archive metadata onto a common metadata schema, enabling joint indexing and establishing semantic links in archival content. The common metadata schema is an enriched version of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/metadata\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step was data cleaning, where ‘dirty’ data that included typographical errors and invalid or incorrect values were corrected. We then enhanced the datasets by identifying additional information and annotating it in the records - this information is mostly related to people, places, armed units, dates and recurrent topics, and we therefore benefitted from <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/glossary/nlp\">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> techniques. Challenges addressed include different content formats and schemas, variations in vocabularies and terminologies, inconsistencies in standardisation of content within the same collection and across collections, as well as spelling and typographical errors, use of Greek and Latin characters, abbreviations, and declinations.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resulting files were expressed in XML format and aggregated. This structuring process leaves room for further enrichment by researchers familiar with the topic. But our primary goal is to support complex research queries. To this end, data was finally organised by linking different sources.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force’s immediate plans include full-scale ingestion and indexing of the material from a number of archives to produce a corresponding semantic graph. The incorporation of new archives would be the natural continuation of our work, and further collaborations would be welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Improved archives to support research\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This ongoing work will improve the current user experience by facilitating access to content in new and innovative ways, in addition to addressing preservation issues. Researchers who use APOLLONIS will not have to search across six different archives or face issues related to the chronology of the items or to the ways in which they had been recorded.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When our work is finalised, researchers will be able to access different archives and enriched resources simultaneously. They will also be able to use curation and content analysis workflows developed as part of the project. The project therefore demonstrates and reflects how digital curation can be an intermediary step to offering useful resources to researchers, and how researchers can collaborate with cultural heritage institutions to enrich their resources.\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The APOLLONIS Task Force is one of the projects on WWII digital resources that will be discussed in a webinar organised by Athena RC on 10 September 2020 in the framework of its collaboration with Europeana Research 2018-2020.

                body: "<p>The Europeana Network Association (ENA) has become a flourishing movement of over 3000 professionals across Europe and beyond who promote digital cultural heritage as a powerful agent in our ever-changing world. In our proactive community we share knowledge and experience, and engage in creative cross-border and cross-domain collaboration on topics of common interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Among the membership benefits we offer to our members is the opportunity to be formally represented in the governance of the Europeana Initiative. Every year, our members elect their representatives on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, who then confer and determine decisions on their behalf. The Members Council is composed of 36 representatives, some of whom will complete their terms and step down this year. We are currently seeking new, committed Councillors to fill nine open seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Responsibilities of a Councillor</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being a Councillor means formally representing and championing the interests of ENA members. As a Councillor, you can help us look into new ways of adding value to ENA membership, support work to make the ENA more inclusive, and develop new initiatives with societal impact. In the coming years, as a Councillor you will also have an opportunity to advise and actively help Europeana implement its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">new Strategy</a>, as well as support and deepen the impact of Europeana’s wider initiative to digitally transform the cultural heritage sector. You will be able to elect the ENA’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> in January 2021, and will have the opportunity to join the steering Groups, and lead the activities of the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">communities</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/working-groups\">task forces and working groups</a>. The Council continues to create new opportunities for members to get involved in community activities, establish&nbsp; projects in the ENA, and build on the vital collaboration with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are looking for committed members who are&nbsp;ready to actively participate in these activities&nbsp;and available to attend meetings that take place three times a year - around March, July and November. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/Councillor-Terms-of-Reference.pdf\">Councillor Terms of Reference</a> offer an overview of your responsibilities as a Councillor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join the Council&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On behalf of the ENA’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Governance Working Group</a>, we are excited to formally kick off the 2020 elections campaign. From now until 18 October 2020, we invite all ENA members to come forward as Members Council candidates to fill the nine open seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want the ENA to be inclusive and diverse, and we welcome candidates from all backgrounds and sectors relevant to Europeana, providing you are a member of the ENA. Whether you're brand new to Europeana or have many years experience in the cultural heritage sector we want to hear from you! We welcome everyone -&nbsp;current students, recent graduates, emerging professionals, cultural enthusiasts and diligent experts working in research, education, copyright, technological development, creative industry, copyright, or any other area related to Europeana’s work. If you’re not a registered member yet, there’s still time to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up</a> - make sure&nbsp; you do so before 1 October 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please send us your candidate profile and submit your candidacy via the button below by the end of 18 October 2020. You will be asked to describe why you wish to run, what you stand for, and what you want to work towards as a Members Councillor.&nbsp; We will then formally announce the candidates and start the campaigning process on 20 October 2020, inviting each candidate to introduce themselves to the ENA. Don’t forget to follow the campaign using the hashtag #EuropeanaElects.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Online formats and the GLAM sector in the time of COVID-19'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In June, Europeana brought together 60 cultural heritage professionals from across Europe for a special series of peer-to-peer workshops on ‘Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, participant Graham Bell reflects on how the GLAM sector can work with\_online communications channels and explores how the Cultura Trust has adapted to this ‘new normal’.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Online formats and digital transformation\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops on digital transformation adopted the platform we all have come to depend upon – the online video conference. It has become our lifeline, our relief-valve, our means of working from home, our down-time leisure and talking to grandma (once she was given the kit and instructions). Some, like me, have discovered that rural broadband is narrow and fickle. We have found that digital is indeed transformative but has its caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COVID-19 has posed an existential threat to the GLAM sector – none of us saw this coming. No amount of institutional risk preparedness or blue-sky focus groups prepared us. Those with a readymade infrastructure could transpose their activity from venues into virtual; those that couldn’t went into hibernation to preserve essential life-energy. The jury is still out about where this will lead – whether we can regain control over our destiny, albeit in a ‘new normal’, or be swept along by prevailing forces. Existential threats by definition pose uncomfortable challenges: are we fit for purpose?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I polarise workshop participants’ reactions to COVID-19, there are those who of necessity or habit concentrate on the next step. Then there are those who look for the distant horizon and speculate: if COVID-19 has the audacity to undermine every premise upon which we have built integrated civilisations, layer upon layer, are the established parameters by which we live now about to be superseded? Being transformative needs managers and visionaries.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reflection of societal values, the GLAM sector needs to inform debate as well as action. This is the domain of the Europeana Initiative. Zoom is good in these circumstances for maintaining dialogue, but it has a flaw. To work, Zoom interactions must be structured. The content of the workshops and the willingness of participants to share openly has reinforced just how incredibly important the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> is as a peer-to-peer community journeying together, especially in the time of COVID-19, into the unknown. Let us not underestimate the value of togetherness which communication can imbibe.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A transformative time for the sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The more enlightened GLAMs have recognised the sector is living through a transformative time in which recording of history (knowledge) and experiences (meaning) is a calling. The workshops have revealed innovative thinking across the sector, transforming the responsibility of play-safe into the inspiration of play-on. No longer (and for the foreseeable future) can GLAMs play curatorial host to curious visitors; telling stories can no longer be the monologue of the informed to attentive audiences. From climate change to home schooling and working, society has seen what ‘reset all defaults’ looks like, so audiences are not what they were pre-pandemic.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of every GLAM are stories. <a href=\"https://www.culturatrust.org/\">Cultura Trust</a> has over 50 years of them. As an NGO developing relationships between place-people-collections using our properties in the heart of communities, the stories range from a Roman settlement to centuries of cornmilling, to the industrial revolution. The default would have been to scan some objects and embed a narrative of them in our websites, but that still presupposes our audiences took the initiative to visit us online. Instead (in a low key way, because we are a small organisation with just a few place-based collections) we were the initiators – through social media, interactive dialogue platforms, webinars with locked-down postgraduate students, MEPs; we became the story. Not everyone needs or has a big budget but COVID-19 has gifted us time to think. We are our most valuable resource for knowledge, and dialogue with audiences is where meaning is born through new stories about the time of COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops have shown digital to be strong on resilient sharing of knowledge but less so in the sustaining of relationships. GLAMs are an expression of humanity, which is why I empathise most with ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-edge-predictions\">Edge Scenario 1</a>’ - a possible future for digital cultural heritage, outlined by workshop participants, where audiences, social engagement, and societal outcomes are paramount. We may be learning from COVID-19 but a more digital-savvy public no longer see themselves as only audiences/consumers: they now expect to be enabled by GLAM. For me, and I believe for Europeana, digital means transforming knowledge into meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=70e7d06bec\">Register to</a> ensure you are the first to hear when we publish the outcomes of the digital transformation workshops and about other opportunities to contribute to the project.

        title: 'New Task Force launches: Europeana as a ‘powerful platform for storytelling’'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A new Task Force run by the Europeana Communicators community begins this month. It intends to research examples of interesting, engaging and effective storytelling from around the web and produce recommendations to further develop Europeana as a ‘powerful platform for storytelling’. Its chair, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/beth-daley\">Beth Daley</a>, tells us about it in\_the first post in our 'Strategy in motion' series.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a> puts great emphasis on sharing best practice and developing digital tools that empower the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage institutions. It talks about innovation and harnessing state-of-the-art tech, and it calls for Europeana to harness its full potential as ‘a powerful platform for storytelling’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I read the new strategy, that phrase ‘a powerful platform for storytelling’ stood out to me. What does it mean? How can we make it happen?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of stories we can tell with the culture available through Europeana is infinite - so how do we go about it? How do we turn digital files and metadata into stories that educate and inspire our audiences? What are the components of a powerful story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And once you have your story, how do you present it in a way that captures imaginations and creates a memorable, meaningful experience? Digital advances mean we don’t simply have to imitate what’s possible in the physical world. What kind of new presentations and experiences does digital provide? Who is doing interesting things right now, and what can we learn from them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m very excited indeed for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">Task Force</a> to begin to explore these questions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A Task Force for a new era</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Much has changed for all of us this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With business travel off the table for the time-being, we’re delighted to have been able to enlist everyone who responded to our call for Task Force members.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members include cultural sector communications professionals, academic researchers, PhD students, teachers and tech professionals and bring a range of interests and expertise from archaeology to narratology. For some, this is their first contribution to Europeana Network Association activities, while others are continuing a long-standing relationship with Europeana by joining the Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/lisa-peter\">Lisa Peter</a> of The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (UK) says, ‘If the recent lockdown has brought anything to light for me, it's the fact that cultural heritage profits immensely from being curated in the digital space, in a similar way to how we curate heritage in physical spaces (although different processes are needed). Those organisations who had already started their journey on the digital storytelling route fared better than others when it came to staying accessible and relevant to their audiences, offering quality content to support home education, and to keep people entertained (and also distracted) during a time of crisis. In my view, it is high time cultural heritage organisations moved \"from stuff to stories\".’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newcomer to Europeana, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/raul-gomez-hernandez\">Raul Gomez Hernandez</a> says, ‘I think storytelling is the best way to communicate about cultural heritage. Creating digital cultural resources based on storytelling is essential to engage people and link them to the cultural heritage and cultural institutions. Cultural heritage is not only to be watched, but it is also a powerful tool for carrying messages in society about any topic. I think this is a perfect opportunity to help with that task.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's Collections Engagement Manager, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy\">Douglas McCarthy</a>, says, 'At Europeana, we are deeply interested in innovation around digital engagement with culture, so we're really looking forward to seeing what this Task Force delivers.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force will meet (virtually) on a regular basis\_and updates on our progress will be available on Europeana Pro News and via the Europeana Communicators’ newsletter.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana 2020 - we’re looking for your contribution'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>At Europeana 2020, we want to explore with you how we can support a sustainable, responsible and inspiring cultural heritage sector for today and tomorrow. We’re delighted to announce the launch of our call for proposals and invite you to join us in leading these discussions.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>2020 is not the year we thought it was going to be. A global pandemic has changed our day-to-day lives. The Covid crisis has brought home how connected our lives are across the globe, while the injustices and societal inequalities that exist between them have been thrown into sharp relief. This demands a response from us. Above all, this year has shown us that we need to build more coherent, coordinated and effective approaches to dealing with the challenges facing society, whether it is a short-lived natural disaster, a pandemic, or the ongoing battle to combat climate change.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is as true for the cultural heritage sector as it is for our wider society .\_\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent months, culture has shown to be a compelling force: people turned to digital technology and communication to share culture and come together as families, in friendship groups and as communities. As we move through and on from these crises, how can digital culture create meaningful and positive change in our society?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now is the time to look critically at the role of cultural heritage, and reimagine it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2020 builds on that momentum to explore how - together - we can develop an open, knowledgeable and creative society.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana 2020</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference will take place online between 11-13 November 2020. It will be a ‘designed for digital’ event that raises voices from across the sector, Europe and beyond, to empower digital change and explore the role of digital cultural heritage in today’s and tomorrow’s world.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We usually attract an exciting mix of cultural heritage practitioners at our events, with backgrounds and interests in tech, copyright, education, research, impact, communications and more. We welcome both <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> members and non-members alike to our conferences, so it’s a great opportunity to connect with an engaged and innovative audience from across the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Call for proposals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for your proposals for an interactive and engaging event, session or intervention to be held during Europeana 2020. Through our work on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">building digital capacity</a> we’re listening to voices in the sector to understand the topics that matter the most to you. We want to invite the best ideas to take the stage, and open up our platforms to new voices and subjects.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that each story or experience can be heard through different perspectives and we’re aiming to take an approach that looks at topics from a variety of angles. For example, we’d love to hear about the human dimension of change, about how the events of this year have, could or should, affect structures and organisations in Europe, and how technological changes can support the role of digital cultural heritage in society.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our work with the Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators Forum, we believe in collaboration. So we’d also love to hear from you if you have imaginative, engaging or new ways to connect people or organisations, build partnerships, engage audiences and network from within or even outside the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our building digital capacity project has begun to surface some consistent themes from you, professionals in the sector. As a guide we’ve listed them below. We’re looking for proposals to cover:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building digital skills\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sector to create lasting change, professionals need future-proof skills, literacies and experience. Europeana 2020 is about supporting one another to help us all engage better with the people we serve.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps you have an interesting idea, project or expertise which could help others build capacity on a personal level by improving their knowledge, skills, attitudes or behaviours? Maybe you can help other professionals and users alike to update their skills to fully participate in creating meaningful and lasting change? Or perhaps you are a GLAM professional with a hands on perspective or case study on digital transformation you are burning to share?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an idea to help individual growth and learning, we want to know about it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovation and experimentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our annual conference always aims to be at the forefront of innovation and we want to hear about the projects and activities that are changing the ways we work as a sector . These could be about new technologies, engaging with audiences, experimentation, agile iteration and risk-taking. And of course innovation doesn’t only relate to technology - we’re looking for innovation that applies to people, processes and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digital cultural heritage and social change</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2020 has provided us with a unique challenge and opportunity to reimagine so many aspects of our lives. We want to give the stage to proposals that will help others create meaningful and lasting social change. This could include ways to address difficult questions around how privilege affects access to culture and inclusivity, gathering diverse opinions, and developing guides on supporting social justice or greening-up their daily activities. It could be training to help colleagues become better agents of change, or advocates for the sector at all levels. Or perhaps it could be ways to increase understanding, representation and engagement of the people we work with and for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bridging digital divides</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early months of the pandemic saw a rapid acceleration in digital activities. Combined with the renewed focus on social and racial justice, many are asking how we can use digital to engage more meaningfully with all audiences and communities across society.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re interested in hearing about innovative and interesting ways to bridge the social and technological divides between people who can access, are represented, and feel welcomed by, digital cultural heritage and those who don’t. We’d love to hear about other ways digital divides can be bridged, be they between GLAMs that have digital capacity and those that don’t, - or between colleagues who are digitally literate and those who are not.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can help others find, learn or be those bridges, send us your proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apply now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadline for proposals is Wednesday, 30 September. To submit your application please <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference-call-for-proposals\">read the information and complete our form</a>. We are forming a selection committee involving members of the Europeana Foundation, Europeana Members Council, Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and members of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">six communities</a>. This committee will define selection criteria to enable a broad and diverse selection, considering actions we support such as No Women No Panel. We’ll share this criteria on our proposals page next week, so watch this space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it’s not all about 2020! We really value and appreciate the effort you put into your proposal so we have looked at other ways we can support you in sharing your knowledge and ideas. In 2021 we will develop a digital programme, populated with events and workshops that share knowledge, host discussions and open up conversations across the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would also like your submission to also be evaluated as part of this broader initiative you can indicate this in the application process. And if you have something you are burning to share that can help empower digital change and isn’t reflected by the themes above, we’d still love to hear from you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can’t wait to read your proposal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please note this call is now closed - you can secure your place for Europeana 2020 below</strong></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Our copyright priorities throughout 2020-2025'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana’s strategy for 2020-2025 imagines a cultural heritage sector powered by digital and a Europe powered by culture. We have identified what this means for copyright, and brought our plans together into a strategy for copyright 2020-2025. In this post, we explore our priorities as part of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=strategy-in-motion\">Strategy in Motion</a> series.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>From 2020 onwards, while safeguarding the core components of the activities that have made Europeana an important agent of change over the past decade, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a> sees Europeana focus on a single task: supporting the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both aligning with and contributing to this task, a new Europeana Copyright Strategy sets out guiding principles for Europeana’s copyright work throughout 2020 to 2025. Our vision for copyright is to empower the cultural heritage sector in Europe to deal with the topic, contribute to accessible and reusable digital cultural heritage, and fully make use of the benefits of digital transformation. We will achieve this through supporting\_ cultural heritage institutions in Europe to adopt best practices, including unified approaches and standards and encouraging the adoption of adequate policies for the sector and in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our priorities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the previous months and years, we have been exploring the environment we operate in to gain a better understanding of the needs of the cultural heritage sector when it comes to copyright (see our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-state-of-play-of-copyright-knowledge-in-cultural-heritage-institutions\">short report into the state of play of copyright knowledge in cultural heritage institutions</a>). Throughout 2020-2025, we will focus on three priorities for copyright:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Follow evolving policy frameworks and practices</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Reach a higher quality of rights information\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Build copyright capacity</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>From now to 2025 we will be working towards these priorities, which are fully set out in our strategy. We hope that this will offer transparency, a reference for those willing to contribute to these objectives, and that it will facilitate engagement with like-minded institutions.\_</p>\r\n"
